# ecs-metadata

This monitor reads container stats from a
[ECS Task Metadata Endpoint version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-metadata-endpoint-v2.html).

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.


Monitor Type: `ecs-metadata`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/ecs)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enableExtraBlockIOMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra block IO metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraCPUMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra CPU metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraMemoryMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra memory metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraNetworkMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra network metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metadataEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS task metadata. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/metadata`) |
| `statsEndpoint` | no | `string` | The URL of the ECS container stats. Default is http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats, which is hardcoded by AWS for version 2. (**default:** `http://169.254.170.2/v2/stats`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
