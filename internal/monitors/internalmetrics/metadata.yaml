    Emits metrics about the internal state of the
    agent.  Useful for debugging performance issues with the agent and to ensure
    the agent isn't overloaded.

    This can also scrape any HTTP endpoint that exposes metrics as a JSON array
    containing JSON-formatted SignalFx datapoint objects.  It is roughly
    analogous to the `prometheus-exporter` monitor except for SignalFx
    datapoints.

    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: internal-metrics

  metrics:
  - description: The total number of monitor instances actively working

    included: false

    included: false
    name: sfxagent.configured_monitors
    type: gauge
  - description: The total number of datapoints that have been emitted by monitors
      but have yet to be accepted by the writer. This number should be 0 most of the
      time.  This will max out at 3000, at which point no datapoints will be generated
      by monitors.  If it does max out, it indicates a bug or extreme CPU starvation
      of the agent.
    included: false
    name: sfxagent.datapoint_channel_len
    type: gauge
  - description: The total number of outstanding requests to ingest currently active.  If
      this is consistently hovering around the `writer.maxRequests` setting, that
      setting should probably be increased to give the agent more bandwidth to send
      datapoints.
    included: false
    name: sfxagent.datapoint_requests_active
    type: gauge
  - description: The total number of datapoints that were filtered out in the writer.  This
      does not include datapoints filtered by monitor-specific filters.
    included: false
    name: sfxagent.datapoints_filtered
    type: cumulative
  - description: The total number of datapoints that have been sent out in a request
      to ingest but have yet to receive confirmation from ingest that they have been
      received (i.e. the HTTP response hasn't been gotten).
    included: false
    name: sfxagent.datapoints_in_flight
    type: gauge
  - description: The total number of non-filtered datapoints received by the agent
      writer since it last started.  This number should generally equal `sfxagent.datapoints_sent
      + sfxagent.datapoints_waiting + sfxagent.datapoints_in_flight`, although sampling
      timing issues might cause it to temporarily not be.

    type: cumulative
  - description: The total number of datapoints that have been accepted by the writer
      but have yet to be sent out to ingest over HTTP.  If this continues to grow
      it indicates that datapoints are not being sent out fast enough and the `writer.maxRequests`
      setting should be increased.
