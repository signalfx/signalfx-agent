### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
