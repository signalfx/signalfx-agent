# collectd/cassandra

 Monitors Cassandra using the GenericJMX collectd
plugin.


Monitor Type: `collectd/cassandra`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/cassandra)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host to connect to -- JMX must be configured for remote access and accessible from the agent |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | JMX RMI port on the host |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. NOTE: under normal circumstances it is not advised to set this string directly - setting the host and port as specified above is preferred. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `customDimensions` | no | `map of string` | Takes in key-values pairs of custom dimensions at the connection level. |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeansToOmit` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come handy in cases where only a few MBeans need to omitted from the default list |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of object (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics.  If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those.  See [collectd GenericJMX](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml#genericjmx_plugin) for more details. |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` |  |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `values` | no | `list of object (see below)` |  |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of string` |  |


The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` |  |
| `table` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `attribute` | no | `string` |  |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - counter.cassandra.Compaction.TotalCompactionsCompleted.Count
    - gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.RangeSlice.Latency.50thPercentile
    - gauge.cassandra.ClientRequest.RangeSlice.Latency.Max
    - gauge.cassandra.Storage.TotalHints.Count
    monitorType: collectd/cassandra
```
