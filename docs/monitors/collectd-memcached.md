To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - memcached_command.flush
    - memcached_command.touch
    - memcached_connections.listen_disabled
    - memcached_ops.decr_hits
    - memcached_ops.decr_misses
    - memcached_ops.incr_hits
    - memcached_ops.incr_misses
    - ps_count.threads
    - ps_cputime.syst
    - ps_cputime.user
    monitorType: collectd/memcached
