## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hostFSPath` | no | `string` | Path to the root of the host filesystem.  Useful when running in a container and the host filesystem is mounted in some subdirectory under /. |
| `ignoreSelected` | no | `bool` | If true, the filesystems selected by `fsTypes` and `mountPoints` will be excluded and all others included. |
| `fsTypes` | no | `list of string` | The filesystem types to include/exclude. (**default:** `[aufs overlay tmpfs proc sysfs nsfs cgroup devpts selinuxfs devtmpfs debugfs mqueue hugetlbfs securityfs pstore binfmt_misc autofs]`) |
| `mountPoints` | no | `list of string` | The mount paths to include/exclude, is interpreted as a regex if surrounded by `/`.  Note that you need to include the full path as the agent will see it, irrespective of the hostFSPath option. (**default:** `[/^/var/lib/rkt/pods/ /^/net// /^/smb//]`) |
| `reportByDevice` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `reportInodes` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
