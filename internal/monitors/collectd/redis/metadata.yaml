    Monitors a redis instance using the [collectd
    Python Redis plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/redis-collectd-plugin).

    See the [integrations
    doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-redis)
    for more information.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/redis
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9100
    ```

    Sample YAML configuration with list lengths:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/redis
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 9100
      sendListLengths:
      - databaseIndex: 0
        keyPattern: 'mylist*'
    ```
