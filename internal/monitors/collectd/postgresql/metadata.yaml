    **This monitor is deprecated in favor of the [postgresql monitor](./postgresql.md).**

    Monitors a PostgreSQL database server using collectd's
    [PostgreSQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:PostgreSQL).

    You have to specify each database you want to monitor individually under the
    `databases` key.  If you have a common authentication to all databases being
    monitored, you can specify that in the top-level `username`/`password`
    options, otherwise they can be specified at the database level.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/postgresql
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 5432
      username: "username1"
      password: "password1"
      databases:
      - name: "testdb"
        username: "test_user"
        password: "test_pwd"
    ```

    Sample YAML configuration with custom query:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/postgresql
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 5432
      username: "username1"
      password: "password1"
      queries:
      - name: "exampleQuery"
        params:
        - "hostname"
        statement: "Select * From test Where host = $1;"
        results:
        - type: "gauge"
          valuesFrom:
          - "test"
          instancePrefix: "test"
     databases:
     - name: "test"
       username: "username2"
       password: "password2"
       queries:
       - "exampleQuery"
