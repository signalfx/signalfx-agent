    This monitor collects stats from Elasticsearch. It collects node, cluster
    and index level stats. This monitor is compatible with the current collectd
    plugin found [here] (https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch) in
    terms of metric naming.

    This monitor collects cluster level and index level stats only from the current master
    in an Elasticsearch cluster by default. It is possible to override this with the
    `clusterHealthStatsMasterOnly` and `indexStatsMasterOnly` config options respectively.

    A simple configuration that collects only default metrics looks like the following

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: elasticsearch
     host: localhost
     port: 9200
    ```

    By default thread pool stats from "search" and "index" thread pools are collected. To collect
    stats from other thread pools follow the below pattern.

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: elasticsearch
     host: localhost
     port: 9200
     threadPools:
    	- bulk
    	- warmer
    	- listener
    ```
    The monitor collects a subset of node stats of JVM, process, HTTP, transport, indices and thread
    pool stats. It is possible to enable enhanced stats for each group separately. Here's an example:

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: elasticsearch
     host: localhost
     port: 9200
     enableEnhancedHTTPStats: true
     enableEnhancedJVMStats: true
     enableEnhancedProcessStats: true
     enableEnhancedThreadPoolStats: true
     enableEnhancedTransportStats: true
     enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats:
    	- indexing
    	- warmer
     - get
    ```

    The `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats` option takes a list of index stats groups for which enhanced
    stats will be collected. A comprehensive list of all available such groups can be found
    [here] (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html#node-indices-stats).

    Note that the `enableEnhancedIndexStatsForIndexGroups` is similar to `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats`,
    but for index level stats

    By default the monitor collects a subset of index stats of total aggregation type (see docs for details).
    It is possible to enable index stats of primaries aggregation type too. Total for an index stat
    aggregates across all shards. Whereas, Primaries only reflect the stats from primary shards. An example
    configuration to enable index stats from Primary shards too

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: elasticsearch
     host: localhost
     port: 9200
     enableIndexStatsPrimaries: true
    ```

    It is possible to collect index level stats that are aggregated across all indexes, rather than one a per index level

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: elasticsearch
     host: localhost
     port: 9200
     IndexSummaryOnly: true
    ```
