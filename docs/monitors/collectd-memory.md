## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Included | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `memory.buffered` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory used for buffering I/O |
| `memory.cached` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory used for disk caching |
| `memory.free` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory available for use |
| `memory.slab_recl` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can be reclaimed. |
| `memory.slab_unrecl` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can't be reclaimed |
| `memory.used` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory in use by the system. |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    monitorType: collectd/memory
```
