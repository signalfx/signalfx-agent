# docker-container-stats

 This monitor reads container stats from a
Docker API server.  It is meant as a metric-compatible replacement of our
[docker-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin)
plugin, which scales rather poorly against a large number of containers.

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.

If you are running the agent directly on a host (outside of a container
itself) and you are using the default Docker UNIX socket URL, you will
probably need to add the `signalfx-agent` user to the `docker` group in
order to have permission to access the Docker API via the socket.

Requires Docker API version 1.22+.


Monitor Type: `docker-container-stats`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/docker)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerURL` | no | `string` | The URL of the docker server (**default:** `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of string` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of string` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want to monitor. 
Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is required for gathering additional metrics.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.async
  - blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.sync
  - blkio.io_service_bytes_recursive.total
  - blkio.io_serviced_recursive.async
  - blkio.io_serviced_recursive.read
  - blkio.io_serviced_recursive.sync
  - blkio.io_serviced_recursive.total
  - blkio.io_serviced_recursive.write
  - cpu.percent
  - cpu.percpu.usage
  - cpu.percpu.usage
  - cpu.throttling_data.periods
  - cpu.throttling_data.throttled_periods
  - cpu.throttling_data.throttled_time
  - cpu.usage.kernelmode
