## Overview

Monitors PHP-FPM using pool status URL.

<!--- SETUP --->
## PHP-FPM Setup
To configure the PHP-FPM service itself to expose status metrics:

1. Enable status https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.configuration.php#pm.status-path
2. Then, configure access through the webserver, i.e. nginx:

   ```
    location ~ ^/(status|ping)$ {
      access_log off;
      fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
      include fastcgi_params;
      fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
   ```
3. Restart Webserver (i.e. Nginx) and PHP-FPM.

## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/php-fpm
   ...  # Additional config
```

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` | This will be sent as the `plugin_instance` dimension and can be any name you like. |
| `url` | **yes** | `string` | Final URL ending by `?json` (i.e. http://127.0.0.1/_fpmstatus?json). |


## Metrics

These are the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
(*default*) are ***in bold and italics*** in the list below.


 - ***`phpfpm_processes.active`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number of active processes.
 - ***`phpfpm_processes.idle`*** (*gauge*)<br>    Total number of idle processes.
 - ***`phpfpm_processes.max_reached`*** (*counter*)<br>    The number of times the process limit has been reached.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `plugin_instance` | Set to whatever you set in the `name` config option. |
