monitors:
- dimensions:
  doc: |
    This monitor will retrieve metrics (see below) from a list of configured URLs.

    TLS information will automatically be fetched if applicable (from base url or redirection).

    The configuration will be applied to every requests URLs from configured list
    so you need to instance multiple times this monitor for different behavior.
  
    It could also affect the dimensions available on reported metrics.
    Some dimensions are optionanly added to its corresponding metric depending of the configuration.

    For example, on status code metric:
      - "matchCode" is always available (default is true when 200). 
      Useful to use in detector to raise alert for every "false" urls.
      - "desiredCode" is always available as information.
      Useful to compare with the actual value of status code.

    In general, metrics and dimensions are available only if applicable
    to be able to create "generic" detector config which will work:
      - depending of the agent configuration (if wanted) instead of duplicated detectors
      - using reach filtering of signalflow to match dimensions
      - avoiding false alerts not reporting dimensions or metric when bad result is expected
    This is why:
      - tls metric is reported only for url(s) where https is available
      - "matchRegex" dimensions is added to content length metric only if configured


  metrics:
    http.content_length:
      description: HTTP response body length. Optional "matchRegex" dimension only if regex is configured.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    http.response_time:
      description: HTTP response time.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    http.status_code:
      description: HTTP response status code. "matchCode" dimension is always available.
      default: true
      type: gauge
    http.cert_expiry:
      description: Certificate expiry in seconds. "isValid" dimension is always available. This metric is reported only if HTTPS is available (from configured url or followed redirections)
      default: true
      type: gauge
