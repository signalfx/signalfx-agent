  doc: |
    This monitor reads container stats from a
    Docker API server.  It is meant as a metric-compatible replacement of our
    [docker-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin)
    plugin, which scales rather poorly against a large number of containers.

    This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.

    For more information on block IO metrics, see [the Linux cgroup block io
    controller
    doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/blkio-controller.txt).

    If you are running the agent directly on a host (outside of a container
    itself) and you are using the default Docker UNIX socket URL, you will
    probably need to add the `signalfx-agent` user to the `docker` group in
    order to have permission to access the Docker API via the socket.

    Requires Docker API version 1.22+.
