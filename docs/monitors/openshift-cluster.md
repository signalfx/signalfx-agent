# openshift-cluster

This monitor is for use with an OpenShift cluster. It includes all metrics
from the [kubernetes-cluster](kubernetes-cluster.md) monitor with additional
OpenShift-specific metrics. You only need to use one monitor or the other.

Collects cluster-level metrics from the Kubernetes API server.  It uses the
_watch_ functionality of the K8s API to listen for updates about the cluster
and maintains a cache of metrics that get sent on a regular interval.

Since the agent is generally running in multiple places in a K8s cluster and
since it is generally more convenient to share the same configuration across
all agent instances, this monitor by default makes use of a leader election
process to ensure that it is the only agent sending metrics in a cluster.
All of the agents running in the same namespace that have this monitor
configured will decide amongst themselves which should send metrics for this
monitor, and the rest will stand by ready to activate if the leader agent
dies.  You can override leader election by setting the config option
`alwaysClusterReporter` to true, which will make the monitor always report
metrics.

This monitor is similar to
[kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), and
sends many of the same metrics, but in a way that is less verbose and better
fitted for the SignalFx backend.


Monitor Type: `openshift-cluster`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/kubernetes/cluster)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `alwaysClusterReporter` | no | `bool` | If `true`, leader election is skipped and metrics are always reported. (**default:** `false`) |
| `namespace` | no | `string` | If specified, only resources within the given namespace will be monitored.  If omitted (blank) all supported resources across all namespaces will be monitored. |
| `useNodeName` | no | `bool` | If set to true, the Kubernetes node name will be used as the dimension to which to sync properties about each respective node.  This is necessary if your cluster's machines do not have unique machine-id values, as can happen when machine images are improperly cloned. (**default:** `false`) |
| `kubernetesAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Config for the K8s API client |
| `nodeConditionTypesToReport` | no | `list of strings` | A list of node status condition types to report as metrics.  The metrics will be reported as datapoints of the form `kubernetes.node_<type_snake_cased>` with a value of `0` corresponding to "False", `1` to "True", and `-1` to "Unknown". (**default:** `[Ready]`) |


The **nested** `kubernetesAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authType` | no | `string` | How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none` (for no auth), `tls` (to use manually specified TLS client certs, not recommended), `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account token provided to the agent pod), or `kubeConfig` to use credentials from `~/.kube/config`. (**default:** `serviceAccount`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.  Almost never needed. (**default:** `false`) |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's TLS cert.  Generally this is provided by K8s alongside the service account token, which will be picked up automatically, so this should rarely be necessary to specify. |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Included | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `kubernetes.container_ready` | gauge | ✔ | Whether a container has passed its readiness probe (0 for no, 1 for yes) |
| `kubernetes.container_restart_count` | gauge | ✔ | How many times the container has restarted in the recent past.  This value is pulled directly from [the K8s API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#containerstatus-v1-core) and the value can go indefinitely high and be reset to 0 at any time depending on how your [kubelet is configured to prune dead containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/kubelet-garbage-collection/). It is best to not depend too much on the exact value but rather look at it as either `== 0`, in which case you can conclude there were no restarts in the recent past, or `> 0`, in which case you can conclude there were restarts in the recent past, and not try and analyze the value beyond that. |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    monitorType: openshift-cluster
```


## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `kubernetes_name` | The name of the resource that the metric describes |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The namespace of the resource that the metric describes |
| `kubernetes_node` | The name of the node, as defined by the `name` field of the node resource. |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod that the metric describes |
| `machine_id` | The machine ID from /etc/machine-id.  This should be unique across all nodes in your cluster, but some cluster deployment tools don't guarantee this.  This will not be sent if the `useNodeName` config option is set to true. |
| `metric_source` | This is always set to `openshift` |
| `quota_name` | The name of the k8s ResourceQuota object that the quota is part of |
| `resource` | The k8s resource that the quota applies to |

## Properties

The following
[properties](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/concepts/metrics-metadata.html#properties)
are set on the dimension values of the dimension specified.

| Name | Dimension | Description |
| ---  | ---       | ---         |
| `<node label>` | `machine_id/kubernetes_node` | All non-blank labels on a given node will be synced as properties to the `machine_id` or `kubernetes_node` dimension value for that node.  Which dimension gets the properties is determined by the `useNodeName` config option.  Any blank values will be synced as tags on that same dimension. |
| `<pod label>` | `kubernetes_pod_uid` | Any labels with non-blank values on the pod will be synced as properties to the `kubernetes_pod_uid` dimension. Any blank labels will be synced as tags on that same dimension. |
