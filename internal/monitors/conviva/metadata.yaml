    This monitor uses version 2.4 of the Conviva Experience Insights REST APIs to pull
    `Real-Time/Live` video playing experience metrics from Conviva.

    Only `Live` conviva metrics listed
    [here](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/apis_data/experience_insights_api/index.gsp#metrics)
    are supported. All metrics are gauges. The Conviva metrics are converted to SignalFx metrics with dimensions
    named account and filter. The account dimension is the name of the Conviva account and the filter dimension
    is the name of the Conviva filter applied to the metric. In the case of MetricLenses, the constituent
    MetricLens metrics and MetricLens dimensions are included. The values of the MetricLens dimensions are
    derived from the values of the associated MetricLens dimension entities.

    Below is a sample YAML configuration showing the most basic configuration of the Conviva monitor
    using only the required fields. For this configuration the monitor will default to fetching quality MetricLens
    metrics for all dimensions from the default Conviva account using the `All Traffic` filter.

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: conviva
     pulseUsername: <username>
     pulsePassword: <password>
    ```

    Individual metrics are configured as a list of metricConfigs as shown in sample configuration below. The
    metrics a fetched using the specified metricParameter. Find the list of metric parameters
    [here](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/conviva/docs/conviva_metrics.md).
    The Conviva metrics reported to SignalFx are prefixed by `conviva.`, `conviva.quality_metriclens.` and
    `conviva.audience_metriclens.` accordingly. The metric names are the `titles` of the metrics
    [here](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/conviva/docs) which correspond to the Conviva
    `metric parameters` [here](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/apis_data/experience_insights_api/index.gsp#metrics).
    Where an account is not provided the default account is fetched and used. Where no filters are specified the
    `All Traffic` filter is used. Where MetricLens dimensions are not specified all MetricLens dimensions
    are fetched and used. The `_ALL_` keyword means all. MetricLens dimension configuration applies only to MetricLenses.
    If specified for a regular metric they will be ignored. MetricLens dimensions listed in `excludeMetricLensDimensions`
    will be excluded.

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: conviva
     pulseUsername: <username>
     pulsePassword: <password>
     metricConfigs:
       - account: c3.NBC
         metricParameter: quality_metriclens
         filters:
           - All Traffic
         metricLensDimensions:
           - Cities
       - metricParameter: avg_bitrate
         filters:
           - _ALL_
       - metricParameter: concurrent_plays
       - metricParameter: audience_metriclens
         filters:
           - All Traffic
         metricLensDimensions:
           - _ALL_
         excludeMetricLensDimensions:
           - CDNs
    ```

    Add the extra dimension metric_source as shown in sample configuration below for the convenience of searching
    for your metrics in SignalFx using the metric_source value you specify.

    ```
    monitors:
    - type: conviva
     pulseUsername: <username>
     pulsePassword: <password>
     extraDimensions:
       metric_source: conviva
