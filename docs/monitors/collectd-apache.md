# collectd/apache

Monitors Apache webservice instances using
the information provided by `mod_status`.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-apache

Sample YAML configuration:

```
monitors:
 - type: collectd/apache
   host: localhost
   port: 80
```

If `mod_status` is exposed on an endpoint other than `/mod_status`, you can
use the `url` config option to specify the path:

```
monitors:
 - type: collectd/apache
   host: localhost
   port: 80
   url: "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/server-status?auto"
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/apache`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/apache)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | The hostname of the Apache server |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | The port number of the Apache server |
| `name` | no | `string` | This will be sent as the `plugin_instance` dimension and can be any name you like. |
| `url` | no | `string` | The URL, either a final URL or a Go template that will be populated with the host and port values. (**default:** `http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/mod_status?auto`) |

## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
are marked as _Default_ in the table below.

| Name | Type | [Default](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `apache_bytes` | cumulative | ✔ | Bytes served by Apache |
| `apache_connections` | gauge | ✔ | Connections served by Apache |
| `apache_idle_workers` | gauge | ✔ | Apache workers that are idle |
| `apache_requests` | cumulative | ✔ | Requests served by Apache |
| `apache_scoreboard.closing` | gauge |  | Number of workers in the process of closing connections |
| `apache_scoreboard.dnslookup` | gauge |  | Number of workers performing DNS lookup |
| `apache_scoreboard.finishing` | gauge |  | Number of workers that are finishing |
| `apache_scoreboard.idle_cleanup` | gauge |  | Number of idle threads ready for cleanup |
| `apache_scoreboard.keepalive` | gauge |  | Number of keep-alive connections |
| `apache_scoreboard.logging` | gauge |  | Number of workers writing to log file |
| `apache_scoreboard.open` | gauge | ✔ | Number of worker thread slots that are open |
| `apache_scoreboard.reading` | gauge |  | Number of workers reading requests |
| `apache_scoreboard.sending` | gauge |  | Number of workers sending responses |
| `apache_scoreboard.starting` | gauge |  | Number of workers starting up |
| `apache_scoreboard.waiting` | gauge |  | Number of workers waiting for requests |



### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `plugin_instance` | Set to whatever you set in the `name` config option. |
