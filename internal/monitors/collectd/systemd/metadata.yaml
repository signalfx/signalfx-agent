  doc: |
    This [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent) monitor collects metrics about the state of
    configured systemd services using the [collectd-systemd](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-systemd)
    plugin. A service is in the state that a metric represents if the metric value is 1 and not in the state if the
    metric value is 0. The name of the service is assigned to dimension `plugin_instance` of the reported metric.

    The collectd-systemd plugin reads the status of systemd services from host location `/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket`.
    The host location must be mounted to the SignalFx Smart Agent container in the docker deployment of the agent. The
    agent container must run in privilege mode. Below is an excerpt of the docker run command.
    ```yaml
    docker run ...\
      --privileged \
      -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:ro \
    ...
    ```
    Below is a sample SignalFx Smart Agent YAML configuration for monitoring the state of `docker` and `ubuntu-fan`
    services. See [here](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent#configuration) for SignalFx Smart Agent
    configuration details.
    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/systemd
      intervalSeconds: 10
      services:
        - docker
        - ubuntu-fan
    ```
    Only metric `gauge.substate.running` which indicates whether a service is running or not gets reported by default.
    The other metrics must be configure explicitly (see below). Also, it is recommended that you include the extra
    dimension `metric_source` with a meaningful value in order to facilitate filtering in the SignalFx app.
    ```
