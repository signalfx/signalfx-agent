# host-metadata

This monitor collects metadata properties about a
host.  It is required for some views in SignalFx to operate.

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: host-metadata
```

In containerized environments host `/etc` and `/proc` may not be located
directly under the root path.  You can specify the path to `proc` and `etc`
using the top level agent configurations `procPath` and `etcPath`

```yaml
procPath: /proc
etcPath: /etc
monitors:
  - type: host-metadata
```

Metadata updates occur on a sparse interval of approximately
1m, 1m, 1h, 1d and continues repeating once per day.
Setting the `Interval` configuration for this monitor will not affect the
sparse interval on which metadata is collected.


Monitor Type: `host-metadata`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/metadata/hostmetadata)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `sfxagent.hostmetadata` | gauge |  | The time the hostmetadata monitor has been running in seconds.  It includes dimensional metadata about the host and agent. |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    monitorType: host-metadata
```


## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |

| `collectd` | The version of collectd in the signalfx-agent |
| `kernel_name` | The name of the host kernel. |
| `kernel_release` | The release of the host kernel. |
| `kernel_version` | The version of the host kernel. |
| `os_version` | The version of the os on the host. |
