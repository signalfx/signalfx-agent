    Monitors Apache webservice instances using
    the information provided by `mod_status`.

    See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-apache

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/apache
       host: localhost
       port: 80
    ```

    If `mod_status` is exposed on an endpoint other than `/mod_status`, you can
    use the `url` config option to specify the path:

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/apache
       host: localhost
       port: 80
       url: "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/server-status?auto"
    ```
