# prometheus-exporter

 This monitor reads metrics from a [Prometheus
exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) endpoint.

All metric types *except for* histograms are supported.  Histograms are
ignored. All Prometheus labels will be converted directly to SignalFx
dimensions.

This supports service discovery so you can set a discovery rule like: `port
>= 9100 && port <= 9500 && containerImage =~ "exporter"`, assuming you are
running exporters in container images that have the word "exporter" in them
and fall within the standard exporter port range.  In K8s, you could also
try matching on the container port name as defined in the pod spec, which is
the `name` variable in discovery rules for the `k8s-api` observer.

Filtering can be very useful here since exporters tend to be fairly verbose.
