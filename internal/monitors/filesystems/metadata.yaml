    This monitor reports metrics about free disk space on mounted devices.

    On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
    If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
    /proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

    ```yaml
    procPath: /hostfs/proc
    monitors:
     - type: filesystems
       hostFSPath: /hostfs
    ```
