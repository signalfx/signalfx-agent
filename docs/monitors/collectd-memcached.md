Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - memcached_command.flush
  - memcached_command.touch
  - memcached_connections.listen_disabled
  - memcached_ops.decr_hits
  - memcached_ops.decr_misses
  - memcached_ops.incr_hits
  - memcached_ops.incr_misses
  - ps_count.threads
  - ps_cputime.syst
  - ps_cputime.user
  negated: true
```
