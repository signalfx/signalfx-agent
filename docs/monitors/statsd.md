# statsd



### USAGE

#### Adding dimensions to StatsD metrics

The StatsD monitor can parse keywords from a statsd metric name by a set of
converters that was configured by user.

```
converters:
  - pattern: "cluster.cds_{traffic}_{mesh}_{service}-vn_{}.{action}"
    ...
```

This converter will parse `traffic`, `mesh`, `service` and `action` as dimensions
from a metric name `cluster.cds_egress_ecommerce-demo-mesh_gateway-vn_tcp_8080.update_success`.
If a section has only a pair of brackets without a name, it will not capture a dimension.

When multiple converters were provided, a metric will be converted by the first converter with a
matching pattern to the metric name.

#### Formatting metric name

You can customize a metric name by providing a format string within the converter configuration.

```
converters:
  - pattern: "cluster.cds_{traffic}_{mesh}_{service}-vn_{}.{action}"
    metric: "{traffic}.{action}"
```

The metrics which match to the given pattern will be reported to SignalFx as `{traffic}.{action}`.
For instance, metric `cluster.cds_egress_ecommerce-demo-mesh_gateway-vn_tcp_8080.update_success`
will be reported as `egress.update_success`.

`metric` is required for a converter configuration. A converter will be disabled if `metric` is not provided.

```


Monitor Type: `statsd`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/statsd)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listenAddress` | no | `string` | The host/address on which to bind the UDP listener that accepts statsd datagrams (**default:** `localhost`) |
| `listenPort` | no | `integer` | The port on which to listen for statsd messages (**default:** `8125`) |
| `metricPrefix` | no | `string` | A prefix in metric names that needs to be removed before metric name conversion |
| `converters` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | A list converters to convert StatsD metric names into SignalFx metric names and dimensions |


The **nested** `converters` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pattern` | no | `string` | A pattern to match against StatsD metric names |
| `metricName` | no | `string` | A format to compose a metric name to report to SignalFx |



The agent does not do any built-in filtering of metrics coming out of this
monitor.
