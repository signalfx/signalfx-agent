    This monitor sends usage stats about volumes
    mounted to Kubernetes pods (e.g. free space/inodes).  This information is
    gotten from the Kubelet /stats/summary endpoint.  The normal `collectd/df`
    monitor generally will not report Persistent Volume usage metrics because
    those volumes are not seen by the agent since they can be mounted
    dynamically and older versions of K8s don't support mount propagation of
    those mounts to the agent container.

    Dimensions that identify the underlying volume source will be added for
    `awsElasticBlockStore` and `glusterfs` volumes.  Support for more can be
    easily added as needed.
