# collectd/marathon

Monitors a Mesos Marathon instance using the
[collectd Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-marathon).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-marathon)
for more information on configuration.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: http
```

Sample YAML configuration for DC/OS:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: https
    dcosAuthURL: https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/marathon`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/marathon)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Password used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `scheme` | no | `string` | Set to either `http` or `https`. (**default:** `http`) |
| `dcosAuthURL` | no | `string` | The dcos authentication URL which the plugin uses to get authentication tokens from. Set scheme to "https" if operating DC/OS in strict mode and dcosAuthURL to "https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login" (which is the default DNS entry provided by DC/OS) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `gauge.marathon-api-metric` | gauge | X | Metrics reported by the Marathon Metrics API |
| `gauge.marathon.app.cpu.allocated` | gauge |  | Number of CPUs allocated to an application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.cpu.allocated.per.instance` | gauge |  | Configured number of CPUs allocated to each application instance |
| `gauge.marathon.app.delayed` | gauge | X | Indicates if the application is delayed or not |
| `gauge.marathon.app.deployments.total` | gauge | X | Number of application deployments |
| `gauge.marathon.app.disk.allocated` | gauge |  | Storage allocated to a Marathon application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.disk.allocated.per.instance` | gauge |  | Configured storage allocated each to application instance |
| `gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated` | gauge | X | GPU Allocated to a Marathon application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated.per.instance` | gauge | X | Configured number of GPUs allocated to each application instance |
| `gauge.marathon.app.instances.total` | gauge |  | Number of application instances |
| `gauge.marathon.app.memory.allocated` | gauge |  | Memory Allocated to a Marathon application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.memory.allocated.per.instance` | gauge |  | Configured amount of memory allocated to each application instance |
| `gauge.marathon.app.tasks.running` | gauge |  | Number tasks running for an application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.tasks.staged` | gauge |  | Number tasks staged for an application |
| `gauge.marathon.app.tasks.unhealthy` | gauge |  | Number unhealthy tasks for an application |
| `gauge.marathon.task.healthchecks.failing.total` | gauge |  | The number of failing health checks for a task |
| `gauge.marathon.task.healthchecks.passing.total` | gauge |  | The number of passing health checks for a task |
| `gauge.marathon.task.staged.time.elapsed` | gauge | X | The amount of time the task spent in staging |
| `gauge.marathon.task.start.time.elapsed` | gauge | X | Time elapsed since the task started |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - gauge.marathon-api-metric
    - gauge.marathon.app.delayed
    - gauge.marathon.app.deployments.total
    - gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated
    - gauge.marathon.app.gpu.allocated.per.instance
    - gauge.marathon.task.staged.time.elapsed
    - gauge.marathon.task.start.time.elapsed
    monitorType: collectd/marathon
```
