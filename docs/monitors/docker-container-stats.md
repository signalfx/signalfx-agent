# docker-container-stats

This monitor reads container stats from a
Docker API server.  It is meant as a metric-compatible replacement of our
[docker-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin)
plugin, which scales rather poorly against a large number of containers.

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.

For more information on block IO metrics, see [the Linux cgroup block io
controller
doc](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v1/blkio-controller.txt).

If you are running the agent directly on a host (outside of a container
itself) and you are using the default Docker UNIX socket URL, you will
probably need to add the `signalfx-agent` user to the `docker` group in
order to have permission to access the Docker API via the socket.

Requires Docker API version 1.22+.


Monitor Type: `docker-container-stats`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/docker)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enableExtraBlockIOMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra block IO metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraCPUMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra CPU metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraMemoryMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra memory metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraNetworkMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra network metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `dockerURL` | no | `string` | The URL of the docker server (**default:** `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `envToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container environment variable names to dimension names.  The corresponding env var values become the dimension values on the emitted metrics.  E.g. `APP_VERSION: version` would result in datapoints having a dimension called `version` whose value is the value of the `APP_VERSION` envvar configured for that particular container, if present. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.


#### Groups
You can enable an entire group of metrics by specifying the `extraGroups` config
option in your monitor config.  The value is a list of group names to enable.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
