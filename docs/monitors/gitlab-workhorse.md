# gitlab-workhorse

This is a monitor for [GitLab
Workhorse](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-workhorse), the GitLab
service that handles slow HTTP requests.  Workhorse includes a built-in
Prometheus exporter that this monitor will hit to gather metrics.  By
default, the exporter runs on port 9229.

To monitor Workhorse using its Prometheus exporter, use a monitor configuration similar to:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: gitlab-workhorse
    discoveryRule: port == 9229  # && <other expressions to avoid false-positives on port alone>
```

See the [Gitlab monitor](gitlab.md) for more information.


Monitor Type: `gitlab-workhorse`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/gitlab)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `username` | no | `string` | Basic Auth username to use on each request, if any. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Basic Auth password to use on each request, if any. |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the exporter using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
| `sendAllMetrics` | no | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering.  This option has no effect when using the prometheus exporter monitor directly since there is no built-in filtering, only when embedding it in other monitors. (**default:** `false`) |

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
