    Collects metrics about a Spark cluster using the
    [collectd Spark Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-spark).
    Also see
    https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-spark.

    You have to specify distinct monitor configurations and discovery rules for
    master and worker processes.  For the master configuration, set `isMaster`
    to true.

    We only support HTTP endpoints for now.

    When running Spark on Apache Hadoop / Yarn, this integration is only capable
    of reporting application metrics from the master node.  Please use the
    collectd/hadoop monitor to report on the health of the cluster.

    An example configuration for monitoring applications on Yarn
    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: collectd/spark
        host: 000.000.000.000
        port: 8088
        clusterType: Yarn
        isMaster: true
        collectApplicationMetrics: true
    ```
