monitors:
- doc: |
    This monitor will generate metrics based on whether the HTTP responses from
    the configured URLs match expectations (e.g. correct body, status code,
    etc).

    TLS information will automatically be fetched if applicable (from base URL
    or redirection).

    The configuration will be applied to every requests URLs from configured
    list so you need to instance multiple times this monitor for different
    behavior on multiple URLs.
