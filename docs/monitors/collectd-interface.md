 Collectd stats about network interfaces on the

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-interface)
for more information.

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/netinterface)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `if_errors.rx` | cumulative |  | Count of receive errors on the interface |
| `if_errors.tx` | cumulative |  | Count of transmit errors on the interface |
| `if_octets.rx` | cumulative |  | Count of bytes (octets) received on the interface |
| `if_octets.tx` | cumulative |  | Count of bytes (octets) transmitted by the interface |
| `if_packets.rx` | cumulative | X | Count of packets received on the interface |
| `if_packets.tx` | cumulative | X | Count of packets transmitted by the interface |

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - if_packets.rx
  - if_packets.tx
  negated: true
```
