# kubernetes-cluster

 Collects cluster-level metrics from the
Kubernetes API server.  It uses the _watch_ functionality of the K8s API
to listen for updates about the cluster and maintains a cache of metrics
that get sent on a regular interval.

Since the agent is generally running in multiple places in a K8s cluster and
since it is generally more convenient to share the same configuration across
all agent instances, this monitor by default makes use of a leader election
process to ensure that it is the only agent sending metrics in a cluster.
All of the agents running in the same namespace that have this monitor
configured will decide amongst themselves which should send metrics for this
monitor, and the rest will stand by ready to activate if the leader agent
dies.  You can override leader election by setting the config option
`alwaysClusterReporter` to true, which will make the monitor always report
metrics.

This monitor is similar to
[kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics), and
sends many of the same metrics, but in a way that is less verbose and better
fitted for the SignalFx backend.


Monitor Type: `kubernetes-cluster`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/kubernetes/cluster)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `alwaysClusterReporter` | no | `bool` | If `true`, leader election is skipped and metrics are always reported. (**default:** `false`) |
| `kubernetesAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Config for the K8s API client |


The **nested** `kubernetesAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authType` | no | `string` | How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none` (for no auth), `tls` (to use manually specified TLS client certs, not recommended), or `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account token provided to the agent pod). (**default:** `serviceAccount`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.  Almost never needed. (**default:** `false`) |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's TLS cert.  Generally this is provided by K8s alongside the service account token, which will be picked up automatically, so this should rarely be necessary to specify. |




## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---         |
| `kubernetes.container_ready` | gauge | Whether a container has passed its readiness probe (0 for no, 1 for yes) |
| `kubernetes.container_restart_count` | gauge | How many times the container has restarted (capped at 5 due to K8s GC) |
| `kubernetes.daemon_set.current_scheduled` | gauge | The number of nodes that are running at least 1 daemon pod and are supposed to run the daemon pod |
| `kubernetes.daemon_set.desired_scheduled` | gauge | The total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (including nodes currently running the daemon pod) |
| `kubernetes.daemon_set.misscheduled` | gauge | The number of nodes that are running the daemon pod, but are not supposed to run the daemon pod |
| `kubernetes.daemon_set.ready` | gauge | The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and ready |
| `kubernetes.deployment.available` | gauge | Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this deployment. |
| `kubernetes.deployment.desired` | gauge | Number of desired pods in this deployment |
| `kubernetes.namespace_phase` | gauge | The current phase of namespaces (`1` for _active_ and `0` for _terminating_) |
| `kubernetes.node_ready` | gauge | Whether this node is ready (1), not ready (0) or in an unknown state (-1) |
| `kubernetes.pod_phase` | gauge | Current phase of the pod (1 - Pending, 2 - Running, 3 - Succeeded, 4 - Failed, 5 - Unknown) |
| `kubernetes.replica_set.available` | gauge | Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this replica set |
| `kubernetes.replica_set.desired` | gauge | Number of desired pods in this replica set |
| `kubernetes.replication_controller.available` | gauge | Total number of available pods (ready for at least minReadySeconds) targeted by this replication controller. |
| `kubernetes.replication_controller.desired` | gauge | Number of desired pods |

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `kubernetes_name` | The name of the resource that the metric describes |
| `kubernetes_namespace` | The namespace of the resource that the metric describes |
| `kubernetes_pod_uid` | The UID of the pod that the metric describes |
| `machine_id` | The machine ID from /etc/machine-id.  This should be unique across all nodes in your cluster, but some cluster deployment tools don't guarantee this. |
| `metric_source` | This is always set to `kubernetes` |

## Properties

The following
[properties](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/concepts/metrics-metadata.html#properties)
are set on the dimension values of the dimension specified.

| Name | Dimension | Description |
| ---  | ---       | ---         |
| `<node label>` | `machine_id` | All non-blank labels on a given node will be synced as properties to the `machine_id` dimension value for that node. Any blank values will be synced as tags on that same dimension. |
| `<pod label>` | `kubernetes_pod_uid` | Any labels with non-blank values on the pod will be synced as properties to the `kubernetes_pod_uid` dimension. Any blank labels will be synced as tags on that same dimension. |
