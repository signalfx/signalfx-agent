# collectd/consul

Monitors the Consul data store by using the
[Consul collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-consul), which collects metrics
from Consul instances by hitting these endpoints:

- [/catalog/nodes](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#list-nodes)
- [/catalog/node/:node](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#list-services-for-node)
- [/status/leader](https://www.consul.io/api/status.html#get-raft-leader)
- [/status/peers](https://www.consul.io/api/status.html#list-raft-peers)

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.

## Dimensions

The following dimensions may occur on metrics emitted by this monitor.  Some
dimensions may be specific to certain metrics.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `consul_mode` | Whether this consul instance is running as a server or client |
| `consul_node` | The name of the consul node |
| `datacenter` | The name of the consul datacenter |
