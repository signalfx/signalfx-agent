    Monitors Java services that expose metrics on
    JMX using collectd's GenericJMX plugin.

    See the following for more information 
    - https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-genericjmx
    - https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml
    - https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:GenericJMX

    Example (gets the thread count from a standard JMX MBean available on all
    Java JMX-enabled apps):

    ```yaml

    monitors:
     - type: collectd/genericjmx
       host: my-java-app
       port: 7099
       mBeanDefinitions:
         threading:
           objectName: java.lang:type=Threading
           values:
           - type: gauge
             table: false
             instancePrefix: jvm.threads.count
             attribute: ThreadCount
    ```
    ## Troubleshooting

    Exposing JMX in your Java application can be a tricky process.  Oracle has a
    [helpful guide for Java
    8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html)
    that explains how to expose JMX metrics automatically by setting Java
    properties on your application.  Here are a set of Java properties that are
    known to work with Java 7+:

    ```
    java \
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=5000 \
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
      -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=5000 \
      ...
    ```

    This should work as long as the agent is allowed to access port 5000 on the
    Java app's host (i.e. there is no firewall blocking it).  Note that this
    does not enable authentication or encryption, but these can be added if
    desired.

    Assuming you have the `host` config set to `172.17.0.3` and the port set to
    `5000` (this is a totally arbitrary port and your JMX app will probably be
    something different), here are some errors you might receive and their
    meanings:

    ### Connection Refused
    ```
    Creating MBean server connection failed: java.io.IOException: Failed to retrieve RMIServer stub: javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException [Root exception is java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 172.17.0.3; nested exception is:
         java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)]
    ```

    This error indicates that the JMX connect port is not open on the specified
    host.  Confirm (via netstat/ss or some other tool) that this port
    is indeed open on the configured host, and is listening on an appropriate
    address (i.e. if the agent is running on a remote server then JMX should not
    be listening on localhost only).

    ### RMI Connection Issues

    ```
    Creating MBean server connection failed: java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 172.17.0.3; nested exception is:
         java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out (Connection timed out)
    ```

    This indicates that the JMX connect port was reached successfully, but the
    RMI port that it was directed to is being blocked, probably by a firewall.
    The easiest thing to do here is to make sure the
    `com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` property in your Java app is set to
    the same port as the JMX connect port.  There may be other variations of
    this that say `Connection reset` or `Connection refused` but they all
    generaly indicate a similar cause.
