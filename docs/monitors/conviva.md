# conviva

 This monitor uses version 2.4 of the Conviva Experience Insights REST APIs to pull
`real-time/live` video playing experience metrics from Conviva.

Only `real-time/live` conviva metrics listed
[here](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/apis_data/experience_insights_api/index.gsp#metrics)
are supported. The metrics are gauges. They are converted to SignalFx metrics with dimensions for the
account name, filter name. In the case of metriclenses, the names of the constituent metrics and the
conviva metriclens dimensions are included. The values of the conviva dimensions are derived from
the values of the associated metriclens dimension entities.

Below is a sample YAML configuration showing the most basic configuration of the conviva monitor
using the required fields. For this configuration the monitor will default to fetching quality metriclens
metrics from the default conviva account using the `All Traffic` filter.

```
monitors:
- type: conviva
 pulseUsername: <username>
 pulsePassword: <password>
```

Individual metrics are configured in a list of metricConfigs as shown in sample configuration below.
Metric values are the titles of the metrics
[here](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/conviva/docs) which are the same as
the Conviva metric parameters
[here](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/apis_data/experience_insights_api/index.gsp#metrics)
Where an account is not provided the default account is used. Where no filters are specified the
`All Traffic` filter is used. Where dimensions are not specified all dimensions are used. The `*`
wildcard means all. Dimensions only apply to metriclenses. If specified for a regular metric they
will be ignored.

```
monitors:
- type: conviva
 pulseUsername: <username>
 pulsePassword: <password>
 metricConfigs:
   - account: c3.NBC
     metric: audience_metriclens
     filters:
       - All Traffic
     dimensions:
       - Cities
   - metric: avg_bitrate
     filters:
       - *
   - metric: concurrent_plays
   - metric: quality_metriclens
     filters:
       - All Traffic
     dimensions:
       - *
```

Add the extra dimension metric_source as shown in sample configuration below for the convenience of searching
for your metrics in SignalFx using the metric_source value you specify.

```
monitors:
- type: conviva
 pulseUsername: <username>
 pulsePassword: <password>
 extraDimensions:
   metric_source: conviva
```
