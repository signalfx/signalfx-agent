monitors:
- doc: |
    This monitor will generate metrics based on whether the HTTP responses from the configured URLs match expectations (e.g. correct body, status code, etc).

    TLS information will automatically be fetched if applicable (from base URL or redirection).

    The configuration will be applied to every requests URLs from configured list
    so you need to instance multiple times this monitor for different behavior.
  
    It could also affect the dimensions available on reported metrics.
    Some dimensions are optionally added to its corresponding metric depending on the configuration.

    For example, on status code metric:
      - `matchCode` is always available (default is true when 200). 
      Useful to use in detector to raise alert filtering only `matchCode:false` urls.
      - `desiredCode` is always available as information.
      Useful to compare with the actual value of status code in dashboard.

  dimensions:
    url:
      description: Last URL retrieved from configured one. Always available on every metrics.
    serverName:
      description: ServerName used for TLS validation. Always and only available on `http.cert_expiry` metric.
    isValid:
      description: Boolean for TLS validation. Always and only available on `http.cert_expiry` metric.
    method:
      description: HTTP method used to do request. Not available on `http.cert_expiry` metric.
    matchRegex:
      description: Boolean for regex matching. Only available if `regex` is configured and on `http.content_length` metric.
    matchCode:
      description: Boolean for response status code matching. Always available but only on `http.status_code` metric.
    desiredCode:
      description: Configured desired code used to compare with response one.  Always available but only on `http.status_code` metric.
