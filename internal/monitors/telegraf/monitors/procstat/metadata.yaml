    This monitor reports metrics about processes.
    This monitor is based on the Telegraf procstat plugin.  More information about the Telegraf plugin
    can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/procstat).

    Please note that the Smart Agent only supports the `native` pid finder and the options
    `cgroup` and `systemd unit` are not supported at this time.

    On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
    If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
    /proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

    Sample Yaml Configuration

    ```yaml
    procPath: /proc
    monitors:
     - type: telegraf/procstat
       exe: "signalfx-agent*"
    ```
