# collectd/kafka_consumer

 Monitors a java based Kafka consumer using GenericJMX.

See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kafka_consumer)
for more information.

This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka_consumer/mbeans.go)
for which it pulls metrics from the Kafka consumer's JMX endpoint.

Sample YAML configuration:
```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/kafka_consumer
    host: localhost
    port: 9099
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/kafka_consumer`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafkaconsumer)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host to connect to -- JMX must be configured for remote access and accessible from the agent |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | JMX RMI port on the host |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. NOTE: under normal circumstances it is not advised to set this string directly - setting the host and port as specified above is preferred. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `customDimensions` | no | `map of string` | Takes in key-values pairs of custom dimensions at the connection level. |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeansToOmit` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come handy in cases where only a few MBeans need to omitted from the default list |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of object (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics.  If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those.  See [collectd GenericJMX](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml#genericjmx_plugin) for more details. |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` |  |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `values` | no | `list of object (see below)` |  |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of string` |  |


The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` |  |
| `table` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `attribute` | no | `string` |  |
