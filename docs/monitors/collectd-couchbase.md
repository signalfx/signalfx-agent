# collectd/couchbase

Monitors couchbase by using the
[couchbase collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchbase), which collects
metrics from couchbase instances

Sample YAML configuration with custom query:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/couchbase
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8091
  collectTarget: "NODE"
  clusterName: "my-cluster"
  username: "user"
  password: "password"
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/couchbase`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/couchbase)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `collectTarget` | **yes** | `string` | Define what this Module block will monitor: "NODE", for a Couchbase node, or "BUCKET" for a Couchbase bucket. |
| `collectBucket` | no | `string` | If CollectTarget is "BUCKET", CollectBucket specifies the name of the bucket that this will monitor. |
| `clusterName` | no | `string` | Name of this Couchbase cluster. (**default**:"default") |

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.


#### Groups
You can enable an entire group of metrics by specifying the `extraGroups` config
option in your monitor config.  The value is a list of group names to enable.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
