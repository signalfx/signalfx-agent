# collectd/df

Tracks free disk space on the host.


Monitor Type: `collectd/df`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/df)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hostFSPath` | no | `string` | Path to the root of the host filesystem.  Useful when running in a container and the host filesystem is mounted in some subdirectory under /. |
| `ignoreSelected` | no | `bool` | If true, the filesystems selected by `fsTypes` and `mountPoints` will be excluded and all others included. |
| `fsTypes` | no | `list of strings` | The filesystem types to include/exclude. (**default:** `[aufs overlay tmpfs proc sysfs nsfs cgroup devpts selinuxfs devtmpfs debugfs mqueue hugetlbfs securityfs pstore binfmt_misc autofs]`) |
| `mountPoints` | no | `list of strings` | The mount paths to include/exclude, is interpreted as a regex if surrounded by `/`.  Note that you need to include the full path as the agent will see it, irrespective of the hostFSPath option. (**default:** `[/^/var/lib/docker/containers/ /^/var/lib/rkt/pods/ /^/net// /^/smb//]`) |
| `reportByDevice` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `reportInodes` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `valuesPercentage` | no | `bool` | If true percent based metrics will be reported. (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `df_complex.free` | gauge |  | Free disk space in bytes |
| `df_complex.reserved` | gauge | X | Reserved disk space in bytes |
| `df_complex.used` | gauge |  | Used disk space in bytes |
| `df_inodes.free` | gauge | X | Number of inodes that are free. |
| `df_inodes.reserved` | gauge | X | Number of inodes reserved for the super user. |
| `df_inodes.used` | gauge | X | Number of inodes that are used. |
| `percent_bytes.free` | gauge | X | Free disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_bytes.reserved` | gauge | X | Reserved disk space on the filesystem, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_bytes.used` | gauge | X | Used disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_inodes.free` | gauge | X | Free inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_inodes.reserved` | gauge | X | Reserved inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_inodes.used` | gauge | X | Used inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - df_complex.reserved
    - df_inodes.free
    - df_inodes.reserved
    - df_inodes.used
    - percent_bytes.free
    - percent_bytes.reserved
    - percent_bytes.used
    - percent_inodes.free
    - percent_inodes.reserved
    - percent_inodes.used
    monitorType: collectd/df
