    This monitor pulls metrics directly from cadvisor, which
    conventionally runs on port 4194, but can be configured to anything.  If you
    are running on Kubernetes, consider the [kubelet-stats](./kubelet-stats.md)
    monitor because many K8s nodes do not expose cAdvisor on a network port,
    even though they are running it within Kubelet.

    If you are running containers with Docker, there is a fair amount of
    duplication with the `collectd/docker` monitor in terms of the metrics sent
    (under distinct metric names) so you may want to consider not enabling the
    Docker monitor in a K8s environment, or else use filtering to whitelist only
    certain metrics.  Note that this will cause the built-in Docker dashboards
    to be blank, but container metrics will be available on the Kubernetes
    dashboards instead.
