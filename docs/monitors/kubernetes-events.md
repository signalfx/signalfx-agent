# kubernetes-events

 This monitor sends Kubernetes events as SignalFx
events.  Upon startup, it will send all of the events that K8s has that are
still persisted and then send any new events that come in.  The various
agents perform leader election amongs themselves to decide which instance
will send events, unless the `alwaysClusterReporter` config option is set to
true.

You can see the types of events happening in your cluster with `kubectl get
events -o yaml --all-namespaces`.


Monitor Type: `kubernetes-events`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/kubernetes/events)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kubernetesAPI` | no | `object (see below)` | Configuration of the Kubernetes API client |
| `whitelistedEvents` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | A list of event types to send events for.  Only events matching these items will be sent. |
| `alwaysClusterReporter` | no | `bool` | Whether to always send events from this agent instance or to do leader election to only send from one agent instance. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `kubernetesAPI` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authType` | no | `string` | How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none` (for no auth), `tls` (to use manually specified TLS client certs, not recommended), or `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account token provided to the agent pod). (**default:** `serviceAccount`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | Whether to skip verifying the TLS cert from the API server.  Almost never needed. (**default:** `false`) |
| `clientCertPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client cert on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `clientKeyPath` | no | `string` | The path to the TLS client key on the pod's filesystem, if using `tls` auth. |
| `caCertPath` | no | `string` | Path to a CA certificate to use when verifying the API server's TLS cert.  Generally this is provided by K8s alongside the service account token, which will be picked up automatically, so this should rarely be necessary to specify. |


The **nested** `whitelistedEvents` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reason` | no | `string` |  |
| `involvedObjectKind` | no | `string` |  |
