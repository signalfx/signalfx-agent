# vsphere

Monitor Type: `vsphere` ([Source](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/pkg/monitors/vsphere))

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Overview

A VMware vSphere deployment includes physical hosts, ESXi hypervisors, virtual machines, and vCenter Server.
This monitor reports metrics for a vSphere deployment by logging into a vCenter Server and periodically
retrieving data about the deployment and its real time performance data.

When this monitor starts up, it logs into vCenter Server and traverses the inventory, gathering and caching all of
the hosts and virtual machines, and their available metrics.

Then it periodically queries the vCenter for the performance data for those metrics. It does so at a rate of
once every 20 seconds, the interval at which vCenter makes real-time performance data avaialable.

Because the 20 second interval for real-time metrics is fixed by vSphere, this monitor runs every 20 seconds,
regardless of the IntervalSeconds value in the agent config.

It also refreshes, at a configurable interval, the cache of hosts, virtual machines, and metrics. By default,
it does this every 60 seconds, but this interval can be changed by updating the configuration field
`InventoryRefreshInterval`.

Compatibility:
This monitor uses VMware's govmomi SDK, which is built for and tested against vCenter 6.0, 6.5 and 6.7.
It may work with versions 5.5 and 5.1, but neither are officially supported.

Sample YAML configuration:
```yaml
monitors:
  - type: vsphere
    host: "172.16.248.140"
    username: "administrator@vsphere.local"
    password: "S3cr3t"
    insecureSkipVerify: true
```


## Configuration

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your
agent config:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: vsphere
   ...  # Additional config

#### Group virtual_disk
All of the following metrics are part of the `virtual_disk` metric group. All of
the non-default metrics below can be turned on by adding `virtual_disk` to the
monitor config option `extraGroups`:
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.large_seeks` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of seeks during the interval that were greater than 8192 LBNs apart.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.medium_seeks` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of seeks during the interval that were between 64 and 8192 LBNs apart.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.number_read_averaged` (*gauge*)<br>    Average number of read commands issued per second to the virtual disk during the collection interval.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.number_write_averaged` (*gauge*)<br>    Average number of write commands issued per second to the virtual disk during the collection interval.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.read_iosize` (*gauge*)<br>    Average read request size in bytes.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.read_kbs` (*gauge*)<br>    Rate of reading data from the virtual disk.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.read_latency_us` (*gauge*)<br>    Read latency in microseconds.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.read_load_metric` (*gauge*)<br>    Storage DRS virtual disk metric for the read workload model.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.read_oio` (*gauge*)<br>    Average number of outstanding read requests to the virtual disk during the collection interval.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.small_seeks` (*gauge*)<br>    Number of seeks during the interval that were less than 64 LBNs apart.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.total_read_latency_ms` (*gauge*)<br>    Average amount of time for a read operation from the virtual disk. Total latency = kernel latency + device latency.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.total_write_latency_ms` (*gauge*)<br>    The average time a write to the virtual disk takes.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.write_iosize` (*gauge*)<br>    Average write request size in bytes.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.write_kbs` (*gauge*)<br>    Rate of writing data to the virtual disk.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.write_latency_us` (*gauge*)<br>    Write latency in microseconds.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.write_load_metric` (*gauge*)<br>    Storage DRS virtual disk metric for the write workload model.
 - `vsphere.virtual_disk.write_oio` (*gauge*)<br>    Average number of outstanding write requests to the virtual disk during the collection interval.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of
metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.

### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
