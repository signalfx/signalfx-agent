    Monitors a Mesos Marathon instance using the
    [collectd Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-marathon).

    See the [integrations
    doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-marathon)
    for more information on configuration.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: collectd/marathon
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 8080
        scheme: http
    ```

    Sample YAML configuration for DC/OS:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: collectd/marathon
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 8080
        scheme: https
        dcosAuthURL: https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login
