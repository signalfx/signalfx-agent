    Monitors a Java based Kafka consumer using GenericJMX.

    See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kafka)
    for more information.

    This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
    configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafkaconsumer/mbeans.go)
    for which it pulls metrics from the Kafka consumer's JMX endpoint.

    Sample YAML configuration:
    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: collectd/kafka_consumer
        host: localhost
        port: 9099
        mBeansToOmit:
          - fetch-size-avg-per-topic
    ```

    Note that this monitor requires Kafka v0.9.0.0 or above and collects metrics from the new consumer API.
    Also, per-topic metrics that are collected by default are not available through the new consumer API in
    v0.9.0.0 which can cause the logs to flood with warnings related to the MBean not being found.
    Use the `mBeansToOmit` config option in such cases. The above example configuration will not attempt to
    collect the MBean referenced by `fetch-size-avg-per-topic`. Here is a
    [list](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafkaconsumer/mbeans.go)
    of metrics collected by default
  metrics:
  - description: Average number of bytes consumed per second. This metric has either
      client-id dimension or, both client-id and topic dimensions. The former is an
      aggregate across all topics of the latter.
