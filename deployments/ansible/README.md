# SignalFx Agent Ansible Role

This is the `signalfx-agent` Ansible role that will install and configure the SignalFx Smart Agent on your remote
hosts.  To install it, you can clone the agent repo to your controller and add the `signalfx-agent` role directory to
its `roles_path` in your `ansible.cfg`, or use this document's directory as your working directory.  The role is also
available via Ansible Galaxy:

```
ansible-galaxy install signalfx.smart_agent
```

To use this role, simply include the `signalfx-agent` role invocation in your playbook (or `signalfx.smart_agent` if
installed via Galaxy).  An ansible-playbook call using the provided example playbook and variable files would be
similar to:

```
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file -e @example-config.yml example-playbook.yml
```

This role sources the following variables:

 - `sfx_agent_config`: A mapping that gets converted to the Smart Agent configuration YAML file. 
    See the [Agent Config Schema](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/master/docs/config-schema.md)
    for a full list of acceptable options and their default values.  The only required key-value pair is
    `signalFxAccessToken`. 

    Here is a basic `sfx_agent_config` that will monitor a basic set of host-level components:
    
    ```yaml
    sfx_agent_config:
      signalFxAccessToken: MY-TOKEN  # Required
      monitors:
        - type: collectd/cpu
        - type: collectd/cpufreq
        - type: collectd/df
        - type: collectd/disk
        - type: collectd/interface
        - type: collectd/load
        - type: collectd/memory
        - type: collectd/signalfx-metadata
        - type: host-metadata
        - type: collectd/vmem
    ```

	It is suggested to keep this mapping in a variable file in the respective `group_vars` or `host_vars` directory
    for your target remote hosts, or to pass it in via the `-e @path/to/variable_file` ansible-playbook extra vars
    option for a "global" configuration.

 - `sfx_config_file_path`: The target path for the Smart Agent configuration file generated from `sfx_agent_config`
   (**default:** '/etc/signalfx/agent.yaml')

 - `sfx_repo_base_url`: The url provided to yum/apt for obtaining the SignalFx Smart Agent
   (**default:** 'https://dl.signalfx.com')

 - `sfx_package_stage`: The package repo stage to use: `final`, `beta`, or `test`
   (**default:** 'final')

 - `sfx_version`: The agent package version.  This is of the form `<agent
	 version>-<package revision>` (e.g. package version `3.0.1-1` is the first
	 package revision that contains the agent version `3.0.1`).  Releases with
	 package revision > 1 contain changes to some aspect of the packaging
	 scripts (e.g. init scripts) but contain the same agent bundle.
   (**default:** 'latest')

**Note**: After the `signalfx-agent` role is deployed, Ansible will manage the `signalfx-agent` service via the Ansible core `service` module.  This module will automatically determine the host's init system for starting/stopping the `signalfx-agent` service, with a preference for systemd (`systemctl`).
