# collectd/consul

 Monitors the Consul data store by using the
[Consul collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-consul), which collects metrics
from Consul instances by hitting these endpoints:
- [/agent/self](https://www.consul.io/api/agent.html#read-configuration)
- [/agent/metrics](https://www.consul.io/api/agent.html#view-metrics)
- [/catalog/nodes](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#list-nodes)
- [/catalog/node/:node](https://www.consul.io/api/catalog.html#list-services-for-node)
- [/status/leader](https://www.consul.io/api/status.html#get-raft-leader)
- [/status/peers](https://www.consul.io/api/status.html#list-raft-peers)
- [/coordinate/datacenters](https://www.consul.io/api/coordinate.html#read-wan-coordinates)
- [/coordinate/nodes](https://www.consul.io/api/coordinate.html#read-lan-coordinates)

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
