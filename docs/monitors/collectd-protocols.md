# collectd/protocols

 Gathers metrics about the network protocol
stacks running on the system by using the [collectd protocols
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Protocols).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-protocols)
for more information.


Monitor Type: `collectd/protocols`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/protocols)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `protocol_counter.ActiveOpens` | cumulative | X | The number of times TCP connections transitioned from the CLOSED state to the SYN-SENT state. |
| `protocol_counter.CurrEstab` | cumulative | X | The number of TCP connections currently in either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT state. |
| `protocol_counter.DelayedACKs` | cumulative | X | The number of acknowledgements delayed by TCP Delayed Acknowledgement |
| `protocol_counter.InDestUnreachs` | cumulative | X | The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable messages received |
| `protocol_counter.PassiveOpens` | cumulative | X | The number of times that a server opened a connection, due to receiving a TCP SYN packet. |
| `protocol_counter.RetransSegs` | cumulative | X | The total number of segments retransmitted |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - protocol_counter.ActiveOpens
    - protocol_counter.CurrEstab
    - protocol_counter.DelayedACKs
    - protocol_counter.InDestUnreachs
    - protocol_counter.PassiveOpens
    - protocol_counter.RetransSegs
    monitorType: collectd/protocols
