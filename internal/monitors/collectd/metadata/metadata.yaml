    Collectd Python plugin that aggregates
    various metrics from other collectd plugins.  It also sends host metadata to
    SignalFx through specially formatted events, and sends active process
    ("top") lists on a periodic basis.

    See [Python plugin code](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-signalfx/) and
    [Integrations docs](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/signalfx-metadata).
