# collectd/hadoop

 Collects metrics about a Hadoop cluster using the
[collectd Hadoop Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-hadoop).
Also see
https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-hadoop.

The `collectd/hadoop` monitor will collect metrics from the Resource Manager
REST API for the following:
- Cluster Metrics
- Cluster Scheduler
- Cluster Applications
- Cluster Nodes
- MapReduce Jobs

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/hadoop
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8088
```

If a remote JMX port is exposed in the hadoop cluster, then
you may also configure the [collectd/hadoopjmx](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/collectd/hadoopjmx)
monitor to collect additional metrics about the hadoop cluster.
