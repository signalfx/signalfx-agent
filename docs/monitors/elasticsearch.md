# elasticsearch

This monitor collects stats from Elasticsearch. It collects node, cluster
and index level stats. This monitor is compatible with the current collectd
plugin found [here] (https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch) in
terms of metric naming.

This monitor collects cluster level and index level stats only from the current master
in an Elasticsearch cluster by default. It is possible to override this with the
`clusterHealthStatsMasterOnly` and `indexStatsMasterOnly` config options respectively.

A simple configuration that collects only default (non-custom) metrics
looks like the following:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
```

## Enhanced (custom) metrics

The monitor collects a subset of node stats of JVM, process, HTTP,
transport, indices and thread pool stats. It is possible to enable
enhanced stats for each stat group separately.  Note that these metrics
get categorized under the _custom_ group if you are on host-based
pricing. Here's an example:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  enableEnhancedHTTPStats: true
  enableEnhancedJVMStats: true
  enableEnhancedProcessStats: true
  enableEnhancedThreadPoolStats: true
  enableEnhancedTransportStats: true
  enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats:
   - indexing
   - warmer
   - get

```

The `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats` option takes a list of index stats groups
for which enhanced stats will be collected. A comprehensive list of all
such available groups can be found [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html#node-indices-stats).

Note that the `enableEnhancedIndexStatsForIndexGroups` is similar to
`enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats`, but for index level stats.

## Thread Pools

By default thread pool stats from the "search" and "index" thread pools are collected. To collect
stats from other thread pools specify the `threadPools` config option:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  threadPools:
  - bulk
  - warmer
  - listener
```

Here is a list of valid thread pools by Elasticsearch version:

| thread pool name | ES 1.x | ES 2.0 | ES 2.1+ |
|------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| merge            | &#x2713;      |        |        |
| optimize         |&#x2713;     |        |        |
| bulk             |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| flush            |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| generic          |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| get              |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| snapshot         |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| warmer           |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| refresh          |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| fetch\_shard\_started|      |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| fetch\_shard\_store|        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| listener         |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| management       |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| percolate        |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| suggest          |        |&#x2713;     |&#x2713;     |
| force\_merge      |        |        |&#x2713;     |


## Collecting index statistics

By default, the configuration parameter `indexes` is empty, which means
collect stats on all indexes. To collect statistics from a subset of
indexes, set the configuration parameter `indexes` to a list of the index
names you want to collect stats for.

The call to collect index statistics can be CPU-intensive. For this reason
SignalFx recommends using the `indexStatsIntervalSeconds` configuration
parameter to decrease the reporting interval for nodes that report index
statistics.

### Primaries vs total
By default the monitor collects a subset of index stats of total aggregation
type (see docs for details). It is possible to enable index stats of primaries
aggregation type too. Total for an index stat aggregates across all shards.
Whereas, Primaries only reflect the stats from primary shards. An example
configuration to enable index stats from Primary shards too:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
  host: localhost
  port: 9200
  enableIndexStatsPrimaries: true
```
