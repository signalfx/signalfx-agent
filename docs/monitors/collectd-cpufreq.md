host.  Useful for systems that vary the clock speed to conserve energy.

See https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPUFreq

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/cpufreq)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `cpufreq.<N>` | gauge | X | The processor frequency in Hertz for the <N>th processor on the system. |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want to monitor. 
Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is required for gathering additional metrics.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - cpufreq.<N>
  negated: true
```
