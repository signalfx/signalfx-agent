# vmem

 Collects information about the virtual memory
subsystem of the kernel.

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
/proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

```yaml
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: vmem
```


Monitor Type: `vmem`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/vmem)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `counterRefreshInterval` | no | `int64` | (Windows Only) The frequency that wildcards in counter paths should be expanded and how often to refresh counters from configuration. This is expressed as a duration. (**default:** `60s`) |
| `printValid` | no | `bool` | (Windows Only) Print out the configurations that match available performance counters.  This used for debugging. (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `vmpage.swap.in_per_second` | gauge | X | (Windows Only) |
| `vmpage.swap.out_per_second` | gauge | X | (Windows Only) |
| `vmpage.swap.total.per_second` | gauge | X | (Windows Only) |
| `vmpage_faults.majflt` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Number of major page faults on the system |
| `vmpage_faults.minflt` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Number of minor page faults on the system |
| `vmpage_io.memory.in` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Page Ins for Memory |
| `vmpage_io.memory.out` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Page Outs for Memory |
| `vmpage_io.swap.in` | cumulative |  | (Linux Only) Page Ins for Swap |
| `vmpage_io.swap.out` | cumulative |  | (Linux Only) Page Outs for Swap |
| `vmpage_number.free_pages` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Number of free memory pages |
| `vmpage_number.mapped` | cumulative | X | (Linux Only) Number of mapped pages |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - vmpage.swap.in_per_second
    - vmpage.swap.out_per_second
    - vmpage.swap.total.per_second
    - vmpage_faults.majflt
    - vmpage_faults.minflt
    - vmpage_io.memory.in
    - vmpage_io.memory.out
    - vmpage_number.free_pages
    - vmpage_number.mapped
    monitorType: vmem
```
