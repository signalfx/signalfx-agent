# cpu


This monitor reports cpu and cpu utilization metrics.

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: cpu
```


Monitor Type: `cpu`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/cpu)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `procFSPath` | no | `string` | The path to the proc filesystem. Useful to override in containerized environments.  (Does not apply to windows) (**default:** `/proc`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `cpu.utilization` | gauge |  | Percent of CPU used on this host. This metric is emitted with a plugin dimension set to "system-utilization". |
| `cpu.utilization_per_core` | gauge | X | Percent of CPU used on each core. This metric is emitted with the plugin dimension set to "system-utilization" |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - cpu.utilization_per_core
    monitorType: cpu
```
