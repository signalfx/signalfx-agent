# collectd/mysql

Monitors a MySQL database server using collectd's
[MySQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:MySQL).

On Unix, MySQL programs treat the host name `localhost` specially, in a way
that is likely different from what is expected compared to other
network-based programs. For connections to `localhost`, MySQL programs
attempt to connect to the local server by using a Unix socket file. To ensure
that the client makes a TCP/IP connection to the local server specify a host
name value of `127.0.0.1`, or the IP address or name of the local server.

You have to specify each database you want to monitor individually under the
`databases` key.  If you have a common authentication to all databases being
monitored, you can specify that in the top-level `username`/`password`
options, otherwise they can be specified at the database level.

**Note:** The MySQL monitor supports MySQL versions 5.x or later.

Sample YAML configuration:

```
monitors:
 - type: collectd/mysql
   host: 127.0.0.1
   port: 3306
   databases:
     - name: dbname
     - name: securedb
       username: admin
       password: s3cr3t
   username: dbuser
   password: passwd
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/mysql`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/mysql)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `databases` | **yes** | `list of objects (see below)` | A list of databases along with optional authentication credentials. |
| `username` | no | `string` | These credentials serve as defaults for all databases if not overridden |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `reportHost` | no | `bool` | A SignalFx extension to the plugin that allows us to disable the normal behavior of the MySQL collectd plugin where the `host` dimension is set to the hostname of the MySQL database server.  When `false` (the recommended and default setting), the globally configured `hostname` config is used instead. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `databases` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.
