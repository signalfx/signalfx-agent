# collectd/kafka

 Monitors a Kafka instance using collectd's
GenericJMX plugin.

This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka/mbeans.go)
for which it pulls metrics from Kafka's JMX endpoint.

Note that this monitor supports Kafka v0.8.2.x and above. For Kafka v1.x.x and above,
apart from the list of default metrics, kafka.server:type=ZooKeeperClientMetrics,name=ZooKeeperRequestLatencyMs
is a good metric to monitor since it gives an understanding of how long brokers wait for
requests to Zookeeper to be completed. Since Zookeeper is an integral part of a Kafka cluster,
monitoring it using the [Zookeeper
monitor] (https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-zookeeper.html)
is recommended. It is also a good idea to monitor disk utilization and network metrics of
the underlying host.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kafka.


Monitor Type: `collectd/kafka`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host to connect to -- JMX must be configured for remote access and accessible from the agent |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | JMX connection port (NOT the RMI port) on the application.  This correponds to the `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` Java property that should be set on the JVM when running the application. |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. NOTE: under normal circumstances it is not advised to set this string directly - setting the host and port as specified above is preferred. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `customDimensions` | no | `map of string` | Takes in key-values pairs of custom dimensions at the connection level. |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeansToOmit` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans to omit. This will come handy in cases where only a few MBeans need to omitted from the default list |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of object (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics.  If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those.  See [collectd GenericJMX](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml#genericjmx_plugin) for more details. |
| `clusterName` | **yes** | `string` | Cluster name to which the broker belongs |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` |  |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `values` | no | `list of object (see below)` |  |
| `dimensions` | no | `list of string` |  |


The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` |  |
| `table` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `attribute` | no | `string` |  |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `counter.kafka-all-bytes-in` | cumulative | X | Number of bytes received per second across all topics |
| `counter.kafka-all-bytes-out` | cumulative | X | Number of bytes transmitted per second across all topics |
| `counter.kafka-log-flushes` | cumulative | X | Number of log flushes per second |
| `counter.kafka-messages-in` | cumulative |  | Number of messages received per second across all topics |
| `counter.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.count` | cumulative |  | Number of fetch requests from consumers per second across all partitions |
| `counter.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.count` | cumulative | X | Number of fetch requests from followers per second across all partitions |
| `counter.kafka.produce.total-time.99th` | gauge | X | 99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process produce requests |
| `counter.kafka.produce.total-time.count` | cumulative |  | Number of producer requests |
| `counter.kafka.produce.total-time.median` | gauge | X | Median time it takes to process a produce request |
| `gauge.kafka-active-controllers` | gauge |  | Specifies if the broker an active controller |
| `gauge.kafka-log-flush-time-ms` | gauge | X | Average number of milliseconds to flush a log |
| `gauge.kafka-log-flush-time-ms-p95` | gauge | X | 95th percentile of log flush time in milliseconds |
| `gauge.kafka-request-queue` | gauge |  | Number of requests in the request queue across all partitions on the broker |
| `gauge.kafka-underreplicated-partitions` | gauge |  | Number of underreplicated partitions across all topics on the broker |
| `gauge.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.99th` | gauge |  | 99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process fetch requests from consumers |
| `gauge.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.median` | gauge |  | Median time it takes to process a fetch request from consumers |
| `gauge.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.99th` | gauge |  | 99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process fetch requests from followers |
| `gauge.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.median` | gauge |  | Median time it takes to process a fetch request from follower |
| `kafka-isr-expands` | cumulative | X | When a broker is brought up after a failure, it starts catching up by reading from the leader. Once it is caught up, it gets added back to the ISR. |
| `kafka-isr-shrinks` | cumulative | X | When a broker goes down, ISR for some of partitions will shrink. When that broker is up again, ISR will be expanded once the replicas are fully caught up. Other than that, the expected value for both ISR shrink rate and expansion rate is 0. |
| `kafka-leader-election-rate` | cumulative | X | Number of leader elections |
| `kafka-max-lag` | gauge | X | Maximum lag in messages between the follower and leader replicas |
| `kafka-offline-partitions-count` | gauge | X | Number of partitions that don’t have an active leader and are hence not writable or readable |
| `kafka-unclean-elections` | cumulative | X | Number of unclean leader elections. This happens when a leader goes down and an out-of-sync replica is chosen to be the leader |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - counter.kafka-all-bytes-in
    - counter.kafka-all-bytes-out
    - counter.kafka-log-flushes
    - counter.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.count
    - counter.kafka.produce.total-time.99th
    - counter.kafka.produce.total-time.median
    - gauge.kafka-log-flush-time-ms
    - gauge.kafka-log-flush-time-ms-p95
