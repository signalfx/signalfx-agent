# collectd/marathon

Monitors a Mesos Marathon instance using the
[collectd Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-marathon).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-marathon)
for more information on configuration.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: http
```

Sample YAML configuration for DC/OS:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/marathon
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8080
    scheme: https
    dcosAuthURL: https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/marathon`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/marathon)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `password` | no | `string` | Password used to authenticate with Marathon. |
| `scheme` | no | `string` | Set to either `http` or `https`. (**default:** `http`) |
| `dcosAuthURL` | no | `string` | The dcos authentication URL which the plugin uses to get authentication tokens from. Set scheme to "https" if operating DC/OS in strict mode and dcosAuthURL to "https://leader.mesos/acs/api/v1/auth/login" (which is the default DNS entry provided by DC/OS) |

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
