## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `vmpage_faults.majflt` | cumulative | X | Number of major page faults on the system |
| `vmpage_faults.minflt` | cumulative | X | Number of minor page faults on the system |
| `vmpage_io.memory.in` | cumulative | X | Page Ins for Memory |
| `vmpage_io.memory.out` | cumulative | X | Page Outs for Memory |
| `vmpage_io.swap.in` | cumulative |  | Page Ins for Swap |
| `vmpage_io.swap.out` | cumulative |  | Page Outs for Swap |
| `vmpage_number.free_pages` | cumulative | X | Number of free memory pages |
| `vmpage_number.mapped` | cumulative | X | Number of mapped pages |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - vmpage_faults.majflt
    - vmpage_faults.minflt
    - vmpage_io.memory.in
    - vmpage_io.memory.out
    - vmpage_number.free_pages
    - vmpage_number.mapped
    monitorType: collectd/vmem
```
