# :warning: End of Support (EoS) Notice
**The SignalFx Smart Agent has reached End of Support.**
The [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/opentelemetry.html) is the successor. Smart Agent monitors are available and supported through the [Smart Agent receiver](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/components/smartagent-receiver.html) in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector.
To learn how to migrate, see [Migrate from SignalFx Smart Agent to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/smart-agent-migration-to-otel-collector.html).
