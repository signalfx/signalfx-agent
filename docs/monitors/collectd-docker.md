# collectd/docker

Pulls container stats from the Docker Engine.  We
strongly recommend using the
[docker-container-stats](./docker-container-stats.md) monitor instead, as it
will scale to large number of containers much better.

See https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin.


Monitor Type: `collectd/docker`

## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
