    Gathers information about processes running on
    the host.  See
    https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_processes
    and https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes for more
    information on the configuration options.

    Example:

    ```yaml
     procPath: /proc
     monitors:
      - type: collectd/processes
        processes:
          - mysql
          - myapp
        processMatch:
          docker: "docker.*"
        collectContextSwitch: true
    ```

    The above config will send process metrics for processes named *mysql* and
    *myapp*, along with additional metrics on the number of context switches the
    process has made.  Also, all processes that start with `docker` will have
    their process metrics aggregated together and sent with a `plugin_instance`
    value of `docker`.
