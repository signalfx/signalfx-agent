# collectd/docker

Pulls container stats from the Docker Engine.  We
strongly recommend using the
[docker-container-stats](./docker-container-stats.md) monitor instead, as it
will scale to large number of containers much better.

See https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin.


Monitor Type: `collectd/docker`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/docker)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A set of dimensions to add to container metrics (see https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin#extracting-additional-dimensions). |
| `dockerURL` | **yes** | `string` | URL of the Docker engine, can be a unix socket path. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` |  |
| `excludedNames` | no | `list of strings` |  |
| `excludedLabels` | no | `map of strings` |  |
| `collectNetworkStats` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| `cpu.usage.system` | gauge | ✔ | Jiffies of CPU time used by the system |
| `cpu.usage.total` | gauge | ✔ | Jiffies of CPU time used by the container |
| `cpu.usage.usermode` | cumulative | ✔ | Jiffies of CPU time spent in user mode by the container |
| `memory.usage.limit` | gauge | ✔ | Memory usage limit of the container, in bytes |
| `memory.usage.max` | gauge | ✔ | Maximum measured memory usage of the container, in bytes |
| `memory.usage.total` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory used by the container |
| `network.usage.rx_bytes` | cumulative |  | Bytes received by the container via its network interface |
| `network.usage.rx_dropped` | cumulative |  | Number of inbound network packets dropped by the container |
| `network.usage.rx_errors` | cumulative |  | Errors receiving network packets |
| `network.usage.rx_packets` | cumulative |  | Network packets received by the container via its network interface |
| `network.usage.tx_bytes` | cumulative |  | Bytes sent by the container via its network interface |
| `network.usage.tx_dropped` | cumulative |  | Number of outbound network packets dropped by the container |
| `network.usage.tx_errors` | cumulative |  | Errors sending network packets |
| `network.usage.tx_packets` | cumulative |  | Network packets sent by the container via its network interface |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - network.usage.rx_bytes
    - network.usage.rx_dropped
    - network.usage.rx_errors
    - network.usage.rx_packets
    - network.usage.tx_bytes
    - network.usage.tx_dropped
    - network.usage.tx_errors
    - network.usage.tx_packets
    monitorType: collectd/docker
```
