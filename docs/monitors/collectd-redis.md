# collectd/redis

 Monitors a redis instance using the [collectd
Python Redis plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/redis-collectd-plugin).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-redis)
for more information.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/redis
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9100
```

Sample YAML configuration with list lengths:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/redis
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9100
  sendListLengths:
  - databaseIndex: 0
    keyPattern: 'mylist*'
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/redis`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/redis)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moduleName` | no | `string` | Corresponds to the ModuleName option in collectd-python |
| `modulePaths` | no | `list of string` | Corresponds to a set of ModulePath options in collectd-python |
| `pluginConfig` | no | `map of any` | This is a yaml form of the collectd config. |
| `typesDBPaths` | no | `list of string` | A set of paths to [types.db files](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/types.db.5.shtml) that are needed by your plugin.  If not specified, the runner will use the global collectd types.db file. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` | The name for the node is a canonical identifier which is used as plugin instance. It is limited to 64 characters in length.  (**default**: "{host}:{port}") |
| `auth` | no | `string` | Password to use for authentication. |
| `sendListLengths` | no | `list of object (see below)` | Specify a pattern of keys to lists for which to send their length as a metric. See below for more details. |


The **nested** `sendListLengths` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `databaseIndex` | **yes** | `integer` | The database index. |
| `keyPattern` | **yes** | `string` | Can be a globbed pattern (only * is supported), in which case all keys matching that glob will be processed.  The pattern should be placed in single quotes (').  Ex. `'mylist*'` |




## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.
