Smart Agent Access Token
*************************

The Smart Agent needs an **access token** (also known as an **org token**) to authenticate with SignalFx. You specify
the access token in a Smart Agent configuration file or, in some cases, on the command line when you run the Agent.
Access tokens are valid for up to five years, so in most cases you get them only once.

To obtain an access token, follow the instructions in the section
[Working with access tokens](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/_sidebars-and-includes/dpm-tokens.html#working-with-access-tokens).
