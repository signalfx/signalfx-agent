# collectd/postgresql

 Monitors a PostgreSQL database server using collectd's
[PostgreSQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:PostgreSQL).

You have to specify each database you want to monitor individually under the
`databases` key.  If you have a common authentication to all databases being
monitored, you can specify that in the top-level `username`/`password`
options, otherwise they can be specified at the database level.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/postgresql
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5432
  username: "username1"
  password: "password1"
  databases:
  - name: "testdb"
    username: "test_user"
    password: "test_pwd"
```

Sample YAML configuration with custom query:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/postgresql
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 5432
  username: "username1"
  password: "password1"
  queries:
  - name: "exampleQuery"
    params:
    - "hostname"
    statement: "Select * From test Where host = $1;"
    results:
    - type: "gauge"
      valuesFrom:
      - "test"
      instancePrefix: "test"
 databases:
 - name: "test"
   username: "username2"
   password: "password2"
   queries:
   - "exampleQuery"

metricsToInclude:
   - metricNames:
     - gauge.test
     monitorType: collectd/postgresql
```
Note that the metric names for the additional metrics picked up from the
queries provided depend on the type, instancePrefix and/or instancesFrom
parameters being passed in.
See [PostgreSQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:PostgreSQL)
for details.


Monitor Type: `collectd/postgresql`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/postgresql)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `databases` | **yes** | `list of objects (see below)` | A list of databases along with optional authentication credentials. |
| `queries` | no | `list of objects (see below)` | PostgreSQL queries and metric mappings |
| `username` | no | `string` | A username that serves as a default for all databases if not overridden |
| `password` | no | `string` | A password that serves as a default for all databases if not overridden |
| `reportHost` | no | `bool` | A SignalFx extension to the plugin that allows us to disable the normal behavior of the PostgreSQL collectd plugin where the `host` dimension is set to the hostname of the PostgreSQL database server.  When `false` (the recommended and default setting), the globally configured `hostname` config is used instead. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `databases` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` | The name of the database |
| `username` | no | `string` | Username used to access the database |
| `password` | no | `string` | Password used to access the database |
| `interval` | no | `integer` | Interval to query the database in seconds (**default:** `0`) |
| `expireDelay` | no | `integer` | Skip expired values in query output (**default:** `0`) |
| `sslMode` | no | `string` | Specify whether to use an ssl connection with PostgreSQL. (prefer(default), disable, allow, require) |
| `krbSrvName` | no | `string` | Specify the Kerberos service name used to authenticate with kerberos 5 or GSSAPI |
| `queries` | no | `list of strings` | Queries used to generate metrics. These will override the default set. If no queries are specified, the default set will be used [`custom_deadlocks`, `backends`, `transactions`, `queries`, `queries_by_table`, `query_plans`, `table_states`, `query_plans_by_table`, `table_states_by_table`, `disk_io`, `disk_io_by_table`, `disk_usage`] |


The **nested** `queries` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` | Name used to refer to the query in the database block |
| `statement` | **yes** | `string` | Statement is a SQL statement to execute |
| `results` | **yes** | `list of objects (see below)` | Result blocks that define mappings of SQL query results to metrics |
| `params` | no | `list of strings` | Parameters used to fill in $1,$2,$... tokens in the SQL statement.  Acceptable values are hostname, database, instance, username, interval |
| `pluginInstanceFrom` | no | `string` | Specifies the column that should be used to populate plugin instance |
| `minVersion` | no | `integer` | The minimum version of PostgreSQL that the query is compatible with.  The version must be specified as a two decimal digit. Ex. 7.2.3 -> 70203 (**default:** `0`) |
| `maxVersion` | no | `integer` | The maximum version of PostgreSQL that the query is compatible with.  The version must be specified as a two decimal digit. Ex. 7.2.3 -> 70203 (**default:** `0`) |


The **nested** `results` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | **yes** | `string` | Type defines a metric type |
| `valuesFrom` | **yes** | `list of strings` | Specifies columns in the SQL result to use as the metric value.  The number of columns must match the expected number of values for the metric type. |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` | A prefix for the type instance |
| `instancesFrom` | no | `list of strings` | Specifies columns in the SQL result to uses for the type instance.  Multiple columns are joined with a hyphen "-". |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - pg_blks.tidx_hit
    - pg_blks.tidx_read
    - pg_blks.toast_hit
    - pg_blks.toast_read
    - pg_n_tup_c.hot_upd
    - pg_n_tup_g.dead
    - pg_xact.num_deadlocks
    monitorType: collectd/postgresql
```
