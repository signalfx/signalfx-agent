    This mongodb-atlas monitor scrapes metric measurements of MongoDB processes in Atlas. The monitor translates the
    metric measurements are mapped to SignalFx metric datapoints then forwards them SignalFx. The original Atlas metric
    measurement names are included in the metric descriptions.

    Although this monitor can be configured to fetch metric measurements at rates measured in seconds, the finest
    measurement granularity allowed by Atlas is 1 minute. Thus multiple requests withing a 1 minute window will
    return the same metric values. This monitor fetches Atlas metric measurements using the finest granularity of
    1 minute and a period of 1 minute. This results in only one datapoint per metric measurement per request.

    Below is an excerpt of the agent configuration yaml showing the minimal required fields.

        Is the Atlas metric measurement MEMORY_RESIDENT.
        The number of megabytes resident. MMAPv1: It is typical over time, on a dedicated database server, for this
        number to approach the amount of physical ram on the box. WiredTiger: In a standard deployment resident is the
        amount of memory used by the WiredTiger cache plus the memory dedicated to other in memory structures used by
        the mongod process. By default, mongod with WiredTiger reserves 50% of the total physical memory on the server
        for the cache and at steady state, WiredTiger tries to limit cache usage to 80% of that total. For example,
        if a server has 16GB of memory, WiredTiger will assume it can use 8GB for cache and at steady state should use

        (or 2x with --journal), but if virtual is many gigabytes larger, it indicates that excessive memory is being
        used by other aspects than the memory mapping of files -- that would be bad/suboptimal. The most common case of
        usage of a high amount of memory for non-mapped is that there are very many connections to the database. Each
        connection has a thread stack and the memory for those stacks can add up to a considerable amount.
