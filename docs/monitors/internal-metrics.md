# internal-metrics

 Emits metrics about the internal state of the
agent.  Useful for debugging performance issues with the agent and to ensure
the agent isn't overloaded.

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: internal-metrics
```


Monitor Type: `internal-metrics`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/internalmetrics)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---         |
| `sfxagent.active_monitors` | gauge | The total number of monitor instances actively working |
| `sfxagent.active_observers` | gauge | The number of observers configured and running |
| `sfxagent.configured_monitors` | gauge | The total number of monitor configurations |
| `sfxagent.datapoint_requests_active` | gauge | The total number of outstanding requests to ingest currently active. |
| `sfxagent.datapoints_buffered` | gauge | The total number of datapoints that have been emitted by monitors but have yet to be processed by the writer |
| `sfxagent.datapoints_in_flight` | gauge | The total number of datapoints that have been accepted by the writer but still lack confirmation from ingest that they have been received. |
| `sfxagent.datapoints_sent` | cumulative | The total number of datapoints sent by the agent since it last started |
| `sfxagent.discovered_endpoints` | gauge | The number of discovered service endpoints.  This includes endpoints that do not have any matching monitor configuration discovery rule. |
| `sfxagent.events_buffered` | gauge | The total number of events that have been emitted by monitors but have yet to be sent to SignalFx |
| `sfxagent.events_sent` | cumulative | The total number of events sent by the agent since it last started |
| `sfxagent.go_frees` | cumulative | Total number of heap objects freed throughout the lifetime of the agent |
| `sfxagent.go_heap_alloc` | gauge | Bytes of live heap memory (memory that has been allocated but not freed) |
| `sfxagent.go_heap_idle` | gauge | Bytes of memory that consist of idle spans (that is, completely empty spans of memory) |
| `sfxagent.go_heap_inuse` | gauge | Size in bytes of in use spans |
| `sfxagent.go_heap_released` | gauge | Bytes of memory that have been returned to the OS.  This is quite often 0.  `sfxagent.go_heap_idle - sfxagent.go_heap_release` is the memory that Go is retaining for future heap allocations. |
| `sfxagent.go_heap_sys` | gauge | Virtual memory size in bytes of the agent.  This will generally reflect the largest heap size the agent has ever had in its lifetime. |
| `sfxagent.go_mallocs` | cumulative | Total number of heap objects allocated throughout the lifetime of the agent |
| `sfxagent.go_next_gc` | gauge | The target heap size -- GC tries to keep the heap smaller than this |
| `sfxagent.go_num_gc` | gauge | The number of GC cycles that have happened in the agent since it started |
| `sfxagent.go_stack_inuse` | gauge | Size in bytes of spans that have at least one goroutine stack in them |
| `sfxagent.go_total_alloc` | cumulative | Total number of bytes allocated to the heap throughout the lifetime of the agent |
| `sfxgent.go_num_goroutine` | gauge | Number of goroutines in the agent |
