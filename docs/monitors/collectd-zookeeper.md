# collectd/zookeeper

Monitors an Apache Zookeeper instance.

See the [Python plugin
source](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-zookeeper) and the
[integrations repo
page](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-zookeeper)
for more information.


Monitor Type: `collectd/zookeeper`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/zookeeper)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
are marked as _Default_ in the table below.

| Name | Type | [Default](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `counter.zk_fsync_threshold_exceed_count` | cumulative |  | Number of times fsync duration has exceeded warning threshold |
| `counter.zk_packets_received` | cumulative | ✔ | Count of the number of ZooKeeper packets received by a server |
| `counter.zk_packets_sent` | cumulative | ✔ | Count of the number of ZooKeeper packets sent from a server |
| `gauge.zk_approximate_data_size` | gauge | ✔ | Size of data in bytes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree |
| `gauge.zk_avg_latency` | gauge | ✔ | Average time in milliseconds for requests to be processed |
| `gauge.zk_ephemerals_count` | gauge | ✔ | Number of ephemeral nodes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree |
| `gauge.zk_is_leader` | gauge |  | 1 if the node is a leader, 0 if the node is a follower |
| `gauge.zk_max_file_descriptor_count` | gauge | ✔ | Maximum number of file descriptors that a ZooKeeper server can open |
| `gauge.zk_max_latency` | gauge |  | Maximum time in milliseconds for a request to be processed |
| `gauge.zk_min_latency` | gauge |  | Minimum time in milliseconds for a request to be processed |
| `gauge.zk_num_alive_connections` | gauge | ✔ | Number of active clients connected to a ZooKeeper server |
| `gauge.zk_open_file_descriptor_count` | gauge | ✔ | Number of file descriptors that a ZooKeeper server has open |
| `gauge.zk_outstanding_requests` | gauge |  | Number of currently executing requests |
| `gauge.zk_service_health` | gauge |  | 1 if server is running, otherwise 0 |
| `gauge.zk_watch_count` | gauge | ✔ | Number of watches placed on Z-Nodes on a ZooKeeper server |
| `gauge.zk_znode_count` | gauge | ✔ | Number of z-nodes that a ZooKeeper server has in its data tree |



### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
