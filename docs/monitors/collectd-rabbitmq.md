# collectd/rabbitmq

Monitors an instance of RabbitMQ using the
[collectd RabbitMQ Python
Plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-rabbitmq).

See the [integration
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-rabbitmq)
for more information.

**Note that you must individually enable each of the five `collect*` options
to get metrics pertaining to those facets of a RabbitMQ instance.  If none
of them are enabled, no metrics will be sent.**

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.
