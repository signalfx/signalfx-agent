# collectd/etcd

Monitors an etcd key/value store.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-etcd and
https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-etcd


Monitor Type: `collectd/etcd`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/etcd)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**


| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `clusterName` | **yes** | `string` | An arbitrary name of the etcd cluster to make it easier to group together and identify instances. |
| `sslKeyFile` | no | `string` | Client private key if using client certificate authentication. |
| `sslCertificate` | no | `string` | Client public key if using client certificate authentication. |
| `sslCACerts` | no | `string` | Certificate authority or host certificate to trust. |
| `skipSSLValidation` | no | `bool` | If `true`, etcd's SSL certificate will not be verified. Enabling this option results in the `sslCACerts` option being ignored. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as [container/host/bundled](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)

This monitor does not send all metrics by default.  The metrics that are
emitted without any non-required config options set are marked under the
_Default_ column of the table above.

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ and has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config and
also any references to `whitelist.json` removed from `metricsToExclude` at the
top-level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
