# collectd/kafka

 Monitors a Kafka instance using collectd's
GenericJMX plugin.

This monitor has a set of [built in MBeans
configured](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka/mbeans.go)
for which it pulls metrics from Kafka's JMX endpoint.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kafka.


Monitor Type: `collectd/kafka`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/kafka)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `serviceName` | no | `string` | This is how the service type is identified in the SignalFx UI so that you can get built-in content for it.  For custom JMX integrations, it can be set to whatever you like and metrics will get the special property `sf_hostHasService` set to this value. |
| `serviceURL` | no | `string` | The JMX connection string.  This is rendered as a Go template and has access to the other values in this config. (**default:** `service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/jmxrmi`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `mBeansToCollect` | no | `list of string` | A list of the MBeans defined in `mBeanDefinitions` to actually collect. If not provided, then all defined MBeans will be collected. |
| `mBeanDefinitions` | no | `map of object (see below)` | Specifies how to map JMX MBean values to metrics.  If using a specific service monitor such as cassandra, kafka, or activemq, they come pre-loaded with a set of mappings, and any that you add in this option will be merged with those.  See [collectd GenericJMX](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-java.5.shtml#genericjmx_plugin) for more details. |


The **nested** `mBeanDefinitions` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `objectName` | no | `string` |  |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `list of string` |  |
| `values` | no | `list of object (see below)` |  |


The **nested** `values` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | no | `string` |  |
| `table` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `instancePrefix` | no | `string` |  |
| `instanceFrom` | no | `string` |  |
| `attribute` | no | `string` |  |




## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| `gauge.kafka.fetch-consumer.total-time.median` | gauge | Median time it takes to process a fetch request from consumers |
| `gauge.kafka.fetch-follower.total-time.99th` | gauge | 99th percentile of time in milliseconds to process fetch requests from followers |
