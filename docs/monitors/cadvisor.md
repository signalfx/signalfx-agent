# cadvisor

 This monitor pulls metrics directly from cadvisor, which
conventionally runs on port 4194, but can be configured to anything.  If you
are running on Kubernetes, consider the [kubelet-stats](./kubelet-stats.md)
monitor because many K8s nodes do not expose cAdvisor on a network port,
even though they are running it within Kubelet.

If you are running containers with Docker, there is a fair amount of
duplication with the `collectd/docker` monitor in terms of the metrics sent
(under distinct metric names) so you may want to consider not enabling the
Docker monitor in a K8s environment, or else use filtering to whitelist only
certain metrics.  Note that this will cause the built-in Docker dashboards
to be blank, but container metrics will be available on the Kubernetes
dashboards instead.

## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| `container_fs_usage_bytes` | gauge | X | Number of bytes that are consumed by the container on this filesystem |
| `container_fs_write_seconds_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of seconds spent writing |
| `container_fs_writes_merged_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of writes merged |
| `container_fs_writes_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of writes completed |
| `container_last_seen` | gauge | X | Last time a container was seen by the exporter |
| `container_memory_failcnt` | counter | X | Number of memory usage hits limits |
| `container_memory_failures_total` | counter |  | Cumulative count of memory allocation failures |
| `container_memory_usage_bytes` | gauge |  | Current memory usage in bytes |
| `container_memory_working_set_bytes` | gauge | X | Current working set in bytes |
| `container_spec_cpu_period` | gauge |  | The number of microseconds that the [CFS scheduler](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt) uses as a window when limiting container processes |
| `container_spec_cpu_quota` | gauge |  | In CPU quota for the CFS process scheduler. In K8s this is equal to the containers's CPU limit as a fraction of 1 core and multiplied by the `container_spec_cpu_period`.  So if the CPU limit is `500m` (500 millicores) for a container and the `container_spec_cpu_period` is set to 100,000, this value will be 50,000. |
| `container_spec_cpu_shares` | gauge | X | CPU share of the container |
| `container_spec_memory_limit_bytes` | gauge |  | Memory limit for the container. |
| `container_spec_memory_swap_limit_bytes` | gauge | X | Memory swap limit for the container. |
| `container_start_time_seconds` | gauge | X | Start time of the container since unix epoch in seconds. |
| `container_tasks_state` | gauge | X | Number of tasks in given state |
| `machine_cpu_cores` | gauge |  | Number of CPU cores on the node. |
| `machine_cpu_frequency_khz` | gauge | X | Node's CPU frequency. |
| `machine_memory_bytes` | gauge |  | Amount of memory installed on the node. |
| `pod_network_receive_bytes_total` | counter |  | Cumulative count of bytes received |
| `pod_network_receive_errors_total` | counter |  | Cumulative count of errors encountered while receiving |
| `pod_network_receive_packets_dropped_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of packets dropped while receiving |
| `pod_network_receive_packets_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of packets received |

| `pod_network_transmit_packets_dropped_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of packets dropped while transmitting |
| `pod_network_transmit_packets_total` | counter | X | Cumulative count of packets transmitted |
