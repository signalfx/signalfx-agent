# system-utilization


This monitor reports utilization metrics for Windows
Hosts.  It is used to drive the Windows Smart Agent host navigator view and dashboard
content.

## Windows Performance Counters
The underlying source for these metrics on Windows are Windows Performance Counters.
All of the performance counters that we query in this monitor are actually Gauges
that represent rates per second and percentages.
This monitor reports the instantaneous values for these Windows Performance Counters.
This means that in between a collection interval, spikes could occur on the
Performance Counters.  The best way to mitigate this limitation is to increase
the reporting interval on this monitor to collect more frequently.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: system-utilization
```


Monitor Type: `system-utilization`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/utilization)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `counterRefreshInterval` | no | `int64` | (Windows Only) The frequency that wildcards in counter paths should be expanded and how often to refresh counters from configuration. This is expressed as a duration. (**default:** `60s`) |
| `printValid` | no | `bool` | (Windows Only) Print out the configurations that match available performance counters.  This used for debugging. (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `cpu.utilization` | gauge |  | This metric shows the amount of CPU in use on this machine, as a percent of total CPU available. |
| `cpu.utilization_per_core` | gauge | X | This metric shows the amount of CPU in use on each core, as a percent of total CPU available per core. |
| `df_complex.free` | gauge |  | This metric measures free disk space in bytes on this file system. |
| `df_complex.used` | gauge |  | This metric measures used disk space in bytes on this file system. |
| `disk.reads.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of read operations per second against a disk. |
| `disk.utilization` | gauge |  | This metric shows the amount of disk space in use on this volume, as a percentage of total disk space available on the volume. |
| `disk.write.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of write operations per second against a disk. |
| `memory.free` | gauge |  | Amount of memory that can be immediately used, in bytes. |
| `memory.used` | gauge |  | The amount of memory consumed by processes and the system, in bytes. |
| `memory.utilization` | gauge |  | This metric shows the amount of memory in use on this machine, as a percent of total memory available. |
| `network_interface.bytes_received.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of bytes received per second. |
| `network_interface.bytes_sent.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of bytes sent per second. |
| `network_interface.errors_received.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of errors encountered per second while receiving. |
| `network_interface.errors_sent.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of errors encountered per second while sending. |
| `paging_file.pct_usage` | gauge | X | (WINDOWS ONLY) The percentage of page file usage. |
| `vmpage.swapped.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of swap operations (read and write) per second. |
| `vmpage.swapped_in.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of swap operations per second into memory. |
| `vmpage.swapped_out.per_second` | gauge | X | The rate of swap operations per second out of memory. |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - cpu.utilization_per_core
    - disk.reads.per_second
    - disk.write.per_second
    - network_interface.bytes_received.per_second
    - network_interface.bytes_sent.per_second
    - network_interface.errors_received.per_second
    - network_interface.errors_sent.per_second
    - paging_file.pct_usage
    - vmpage.swapped.per_second
    - vmpage.swapped_in.per_second
    - vmpage.swapped_out.per_second
    monitorType: system-utilization
```
