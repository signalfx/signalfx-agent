    This monitor lets you provide custom collectd
    configuration to be run by the managed collectd instance.  You can provide
    configuration for as many plugins as you want in a single instance of this
    monitor configuration by either putting multiple `<Plugin>` blocks in a
    single `template` option, or specifying multiple `templates`.

    Note that a distinct instance of collectd is run for each instance of this
    monitor, so it is more efficient to group plugin configurations into a
    single monitor configuration (either in one big `template` text blob, or
    split into multiple `templates`).  You should not group configurations if
    using a discoveryRule since that would result in duplicate config for each
    instance of the service endpoint discovered.

    You can also use your own Python plugins in conjunction with the
    `ModulePath` option in
    [collectd-python](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-python.5.shtml).
    If your Python plugin has dependencies of its own, you can specify the path
    to them by specifying multiple `ModulePath` options with those paths.

    Here is an example of a configuration with a custom Python plugin:

    ```yaml
      - type: collectd/custom
        discoveryRule: container_image =~ "myservice"
        template: |
          LoadPlugin "python"
          <Plugin python>
            ModulePath "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/health_checker"
            Import "health_checker"
            <Module health_checker>
              URL "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}"
              JSONKey "isRunning"
              JSONVal "1"
            </Module>
          </Plugin>
    ```

    We have many collectd plugins included in the image that are not exposed as
    monitors.  You can see the plugins in the `<AGENT_BUNDLE>/plugins/collectd`
    directory, where `<AGENT_BUNDLE>` is blank in the containerized version, and
    is normally `/usr/lib/signalfx-agent` in the non-containerized agent.
