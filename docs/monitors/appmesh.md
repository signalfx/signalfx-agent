# appmesh

This monitor starts a StatsD monitor to listen to StatsD metrics emitted
by AWS AppMesh Envoy Proxy.

To report AppMesh Envoy metrics, you need to enable Envoy StatsD sink on AppMesh
and deploy the agent as a sidecar in the services that need to be monitored.


Sample Envoy StatsD configuration:

```yaml
stats_sinks:
 -
  name: "envoy.statsd"
  config:
   address:
    socket_address:
     address: "127.0.0.1"
     port_value: 8125
     protocol: "UDP"
   prefix: statsd.appmesh
```
Please remember to provide the prefix to the agent monitor configuration.

See [Envoy API reference](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-metrics-v2-statsdsink) for more info

Sample SignalFx SmartAgent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: appmesh
   listenAddress: 0.0.0.0
   listenPort: 8125
   metricPrefix: statsd.appmesh
```


Monitor Type: `appmesh`

### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
