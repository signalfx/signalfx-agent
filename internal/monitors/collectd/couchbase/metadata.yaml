    Monitors couchbase by using the
    [couchbase collectd Python
    plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-couchbase), which collects
    metrics from couchbase instances

    Sample YAML configuration with custom query:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/couchbase
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 8091
      collectTarget: "NODE"
      clusterName: "my-cluster"
      username: "user"
      password: "password"
    ```
