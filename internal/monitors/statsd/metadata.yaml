    ### USAGE

    #### Adding dimensions to StatsD metrics

    The StatsD monitor can parse keywords from a statsd metric name by a set of
    converters that was configured by user.

    ```
    converters:
      - pattern: "cluster.cds_{traffic}_{mesh}_{service}-vn_{}.{action}"
        ...
    ```

    This converter will parse `traffic`, `mesh`, `service` and `action` as dimensions
    from a metric name `cluster.cds_egress_ecommerce-demo-mesh_gateway-vn_tcp_8080.update_success`.
    If a section has only a pair of brackets without a name, it will not capture a dimension.

    When multiple converters were provided, a metric will be converted by the first converter with a
    matching pattern to the metric name.

    #### Formatting metric name

    You can customize a metric name by providing a format string within the converter configuration.

    ```
    converters:
      - pattern: "cluster.cds_{traffic}_{mesh}_{service}-vn_{}.{action}"
        metric: "{traffic}.{action}"
    ```

    The metrics which match to the given pattern will be reported to SignalFx as `{traffic}.{action}`.
    For instance, metric `cluster.cds_egress_ecommerce-demo-mesh_gateway-vn_tcp_8080.update_success`
    will be reported as `egress.update_success`.

    `metric` is required for a converter configuration. A converter will be disabled if `metric` is not provided.
