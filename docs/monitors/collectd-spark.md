# collectd/spark

 Collects metrics about a Spark cluster using the
[collectd Spark Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-spark).
Also see
https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-spark.

You have to specify distinct monitor configurations and discovery rules for
master and worker processes.  For the master configuration, set `isMaster`
to true.

We only support HTTP endpoints for now.

When running Spark on Apache Hadoop / Yarn, this integration is only capable
of reporting application metrics from the master node.  Please use the
collectd/hadoop monitor to report on the health of the cluster.

An example configuration for monitoring applications on Yarn
```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/spark
    host: 000.000.000.000
    port: 8088
    clusterType: Yarn
    isMaster: true
    collectApplicationMetrics: true
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/spark`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/spark)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `moduleName` | no | `string` | Corresponds to the ModuleName option in collectd-python |
| `modulePaths` | no | `list of string` | Corresponds to a set of ModulePath options in collectd-python |
| `pluginConfig` | no | `map of any` | This is a yaml form of the collectd config. |
| `typesDBPaths` | no | `list of string` | A set of paths to [types.db files](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/types.db.5.shtml) that are needed by your plugin.  If not specified, the runner will use the global collectd types.db file. |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `isMaster` | no | `bool` | Set to `true` when monitoring a master Spark node (**default:** `false`) |
| `clusterType` | **yes** | `string` | Should be one of `Standalone` or `Mesos` or `Yarn`.  Cluster metrics will not be collected on Yarn.  Please use the collectd/hadoop monitor to gain insights to your cluster's health. |
| `collectApplicationMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |
