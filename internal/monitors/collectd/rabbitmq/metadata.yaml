    Monitors an instance of RabbitMQ using the
    [collectd RabbitMQ Python
    Plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-rabbitmq).

    See the [integration
    doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-rabbitmq)
    for more information.

    **Note that you must individually enable each of the five `collect*` options
    to get metrics pertaining to those facets of a RabbitMQ instance.  If none
    of them are enabled, no metrics will be sent.**
