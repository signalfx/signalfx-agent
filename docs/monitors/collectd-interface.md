# collectd/interface

Collectd stats about network interfaces on the
system by using the [collectd interface
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Interface).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-interface)
for more information.


Monitor Type: `collectd/interface`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/netinterface)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `if_errors.rx` | cumulative |  | Count of receive errors on the interface |
| `if_errors.tx` | cumulative |  | Count of transmit errors on the interface |
| `if_octets.rx` | cumulative |  | Count of bytes (octets) received on the interface |
| `if_octets.tx` | cumulative |  | Count of bytes (octets) transmitted by the interface |
| `if_packets.rx` | cumulative | X | Count of packets received on the interface |
| `if_packets.tx` | cumulative | X | Count of packets transmitted by the interface |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - if_packets.rx
    - if_packets.tx
    monitorType: collectd/interface
```
