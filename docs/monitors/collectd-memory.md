cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |

| `memory.cached` | gauge |  | Bytes of memory used for disk caching |
| `memory.free` | gauge |  | Bytes of memory available for use |
| `memory.slab_recl` | gauge |  | Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can be reclaimed. |
| `memory.slab_unrecl` | gauge |  | Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can't be reclaimed |
| `memory.used` | gauge |  | Bytes of memory in use by the system. |

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  negated: true
```
