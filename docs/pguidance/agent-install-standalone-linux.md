# Install to Linux using a GZIP File

Install the Smart Agent to Linux host using a compressed
standalone package in a GZIP file.

## Prerequisites

* Kernel version 2.6.32 or higher
* CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH and CAP_SYS_PTRACE capabilities
* Terminal or a similar command-line interface application
* GZIP application

## Install the Smart Agent using a GZIP file

1. Remove collector services such as `collectd`

2. Remove third-party instrumentation and agent software

> Don't use automatic instrumentation or instrumentation agents from
> other vendors when you're using SignalFx instrumentation. The results
> are unpredictable, and your instrumentation might break and your
> application might crash.

3. Get the latest GZIP standalone installation package by navigating to
   [Smart Agent releases](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/releases)
   and downloading the following file:

   ```
   signalfx-agent-<latest_version>.tar.gz
   ```

   For example, if the latest version is **5.1.6**, perform the following steps:

   1. In the **releases** section, find the section called **v5.1.6**.
   2. In the **Assets** section, click `signalfx-agent-5.1.6.tar.gz`
   3. The GZIP file starts downloading.

4. To uncompress the package, run the following command:

   ```
   tar xzf signalfx-agent-<latest_version>.tar.gz
   ```

   The package expands into the `signalfx-agent` directory.

5. Navigate to the `signalfx-agent` directory:

   ```
   cd signalfx-agent
   ```


6. To ensure that the binaries in the install files use the correct loader for your host, run
the following command:

   ```
   bin/patch-interpreter $(pwd)
   ```

## Configure the GZIP installation

Create a configuration file for the agent:

1. In a text editor, create the file called signalfx-agent/agent-config.yaml.
2. In the file, add your hostname and port number:

   ```
   internalStatusHost: <local_hostname>
   internalStatusPort: <local_port>
   collectd:
     configDir: <collectd_config_dir>
   ```

3. Save the file.

> The Smart Agent collects metrics based on the settings in
> `agent-config.yaml`. The `internalStatusHost` and `internalStatusPort`
> properties specify the host and port number of the host that's running the Smart Agent.
> The `collectd.configDir` property specifies the directory where the Smart Agent writes
> `collectd` configuration files.

### Start the Smart Agent

To start the Smart Agent, run this command:

```
signalfx-agent/bin/signalfx-agent -config signalfx-agent/agent-config.yaml > <log_file>
```

> The default log output for the Smart Agent goes to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.
> To persist log output, direct the log output to `<log_file>`.

### Verify the Smart Agent

To verify that your installation and configuration, perform these steps:

* For infrastructure monitoring, perform these steps:
  1. In SignalFx UI, open the **Infrastructure** built-in dashboard
  2. In the override bar at the top of the back, select **Choose a host**. Select one of your hosts from the dropdown.

  The charts display metrics from your infrastructure.

  To learn more, see [Built-In Dashboards and Charts](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/getting-started/built-in-content/built-in-dashboards.html).

* For Kubernetes monitoring, perform these steps:
  1. In SignalFx, from the main menu select **Infrastructure** > **Kubernetes Navigator** > **Cluster map**.
  2. In the cluster display, find the cluster you installed.
  3. Click the magnification icon to view the nodes in the cluster.

  The detail pane displays details of your cluster and nodes.

* For APM monitoring, learn how to install, configure, and verify the Smart Agent for Microservices APM (**µAPM**). See
  [Overview of Microservices APM (µAPM)](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/apm2/apm2-overview/apm2-overview.html).
