# collectd/kong

Monitors a Kong instance using [collectd-kong](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong).

See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kong)
for more information.

The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/kong
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8001
    metrics:
      - metric: request_latency
        report: true
      - metric: connections_accepted
        report: false
```

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - counter.kong.connections.accepted
    - counter.kong.connections.handled
    monitorType: collectd/kong
```
