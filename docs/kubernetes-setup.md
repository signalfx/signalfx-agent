# Kubernetes Setup

The agent was first written for Kubernetes and is relatively easy to setup in a
cluster.  The agent is intended to be run on each node and will monitor
services running on those same nodes to minimize cross-node traffic.

For information on monitoring kubernetes, see [Monitoring Kubernetes](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/kubernetes/index.html).
