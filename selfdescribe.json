You should not group configurations if\nusing a discoveryRule since that would result in duplicate config for each\ninstance of the service endpoint discovered.\n\nYou can also use your own Python plugins in conjunction with the\n`ModulePath` option in\n[collectd-python](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-python.5.shtml).\nIf your Python plugin has dependencies of its own, you can specify the path\nto them by specifying multiple `ModulePath` options with those paths.\n\nHere is an example of a configuration with a custom Python plugin:\n\n```yaml\n  - type: collectd/custom\n    discoveryRule: container_image =~ \"myservice\"\n    template: |\n      LoadPlugin \"python\"\n      \u003cPlugin python\u003e\n        ModulePath \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/health_checker\"\n        Import \"health_checker\"\n        \u003cModule health_checker\u003e\n          URL \"http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}\"\n          JSONKey \"isRunning\"\n          JSONVal \"1\"\n        \u003c/Module\u003e\n      \u003c/Plugin\u003e\n```\n\nWe have many collectd plugins included in the image that are not exposed as\nmonitors.  You can see the plugins in the `\u003cAGENT_BUNDLE\u003e/plugins/collectd`\ndirectory, where `\u003cAGENT_BUNDLE\u003e` is blank in the containerized version, and\nis normally `/usr/lib/signalfx-agent` in the non-containerized agent.\n",

Oracle has a\n[helpful guide for Java\n8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html)\nthat explains how to expose JMX metrics automatically by setting Java\nproperties on your application.  Here are a set of Java properties that are\nknown to work with Java 7+:\n\n```\njava \\\n  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=5000 \\\n  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \\\n  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \\\n  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=5000 \\\n  ...\n```\n\nThis should work as long as the agent is allowed to access port 5000 on the\nJava app's host (i.e. there is no firewall blocking it).  Note that this\ndoes not enable authentication or encryption, but these can be added if\ndesired.\n\nAssuming you have the `host` config set to `172.17.0.3` and the port set to\n`5000` (this is a totally arbitrary port and your JMX app will probably be\nsomething different), here are some errors you might receive and their\nmeanings:\n\n### Connection Refused\n```\nCreating MBean server connection failed: java.io.IOException: Failed to retrieve RMIServer stub: javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException [Root exception is java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 172.17.0.3; nested exception is:\n     java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)]\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the JMX connect port is not open on the specified\nhost.  Confirm (via netstat/ss or some other tool) that this port\nis indeed open on the configured host, and is listening on an appropriate\naddress (i.e. if the agent is running on a remote server then JMX should not\nbe listening on localhost only).\n\n### RMI Connection Issues\n\n```\nCreating MBean server connection failed: java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: 172.17.0.3; nested exception is:\n     java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out (Connection timed out)\n```\n\nThis indicates that the JMX connect port was reached successfully, but the\nRMI port that it was directed to is being blocked, probably by a firewall.\nThe easiest thing to do here is to make sure the\n`com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port` property in your Java app is set to\nthe same port as the JMX connect port.  There may be other variations of\nthis that say `Connection reset` or `Connection refused` but they all\ngeneraly indicate a similar cause.\n\n## Useful links\n\n - https://realjenius.com/2012/11/21/java7-jmx-tunneling-freedom/\n",

Use this plugin to send data from StatsD to SignalFx [statsd\nplugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:StatsD).\n\nSignalFx supports `Counter`, `Timer` and `Gauge` types which are dispatched\nas the collectd types - `derive`, `latency` and `gauge` respectively.\nIn SignalFx, for a statsd metric, its collectd type is attached as a\nprefix to the metric name. As an example, if you send in the gauge -\n\n```\n$ echo \"statsd.test:1|g\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125\n```\n\nThis will be reported to SignalFx as \"gauge.statsd.test\"\n\n### USAGE\n\n#### Adding dimensions to StatsD metrics\n\nAdd dimensions to your metrics by adding key-value pairs to your StatsD\nmetric names as follows:\n\n```\n$ echo \"statsd.[foo=bar,dim=val]test:1|g\" | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 8125\n```\n\nThis creates a metric called `statsd.test` of type gauge, with dimensions\n`foo=bar` and `dim=val`.\n\n#### Delete[Type]s boolean setting\n\nThese options control what happens if metrics are not updated in an\ninterval. If set to False, the default, metrics are dispatched unchanged,\ni.e. the rate of counters and size of sets will be zero, timers report NaN\nand gauges are unchanged. If set to True, the such metrics are not\ndispatched and removed from the internal cache.\n\nSignalFx's default configuration for this plugin sets all `Delete[Type]s`\nconfiguration options to `True`. We strongly recommend this in order to\nensure that metrics that have stopped reporting are not reported as 0 in\nperpetuity. Setting these parameters to `False` results in collectd's memory\nusage increasing over time, as the set of metrics reported from StatsD grows\nindefinitely. This is especially important in environments that are\nlong-running or whose metrics change frequently.\n\n#### CounterSum boolean setting\n\nWhen enabled, creates a count metric which reports the change since the last\nread. This option primarily exists for compatibility with the statsd\nimplementation by Etsy.\n\nIf you are only looking at the counts generated by each reporting interval,\nequivalent to\n[Counters](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/concepts/metric-types.html?highlight=Counters)\nin SignalFx then we'd recommend that you set CounterSum to `True`. It will\nsend in an additional counter metric with a prefix of `count`.\n\nSample YAML configuration:\n\n```\nmonitors:\n - type: collectd/statsd\n   listenAddress: \"0.0.0.0\"\n   listenPort: 8125\n   deleteSets: true\n   timerPercentile: 90.0\n```\n",

All metrics are gauges. The Conviva metrics are converted to SignalFx metrics with dimensions\nnamed account and filter. The account dimension is the name of the Conviva account and the filter dimension\nis the name of the Conviva filter applied to the metric. In the case of MetricLenses, the constituent\nMetricLens metrics and MetricLens dimensions are included. The values of the MetricLens dimensions are\nderived from the values of the associated MetricLens dimension entities.\n\nBelow is a sample YAML configuration showing the most basic configuration of the Conviva monitor\nusing only the required fields. For this configuration the monitor will default to fetching quality MetricLens\nmetrics for all dimensions from the default Conviva account using the `All Traffic` filter.\n\n```\nmonitors:\n- type: conviva\n pulseUsername: \u003cusername\u003e\n pulsePassword: \u003cpassword\u003e\n```\n\nIndividual metrics are configured as a list of metricConfigs as shown in sample configuration below. The\nmetrics a fetched using the specified metricParameter. Find the list of metric parameters\n[here](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/blob/master/conviva/docs/conviva_metrics.md).\nThe Conviva metrics reported to SignalFx are prefixed by `conviva.`, `conviva.quality_metriclens.` and\n`conviva.audience_metriclens.` accordingly. The metric names are the `titles` of the metrics\n[here](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/conviva/docs) which correspond to the Conviva\n`metric parameters` [here](https://community.conviva.com/site/global/apis_data/experience_insights_api/index.gsp#metrics).\nWhere an account is not provided the default account is fetched and used. Where no filters are specified the\n`All Traffic` filter is used. Where MetricLens dimensions are not specified all MetricLens dimensions\nare fetched and used. The `_ALL_` keyword means all. MetricLens dimension configuration applies only to MetricLenses.\nIf specified for a regular metric they will be ignored. MetricLens dimensions listed in `excludeMetricLensDimensions`\nwill be excluded.\n\n```\nmonitors:\n- type: conviva\n pulseUsername: \u003cusername\u003e\n pulsePassword: \u003cpassword\u003e\n metricConfigs:\n   - account: c3.NBC\n     metricParameter: quality_metriclens\n     filters:\n       - All Traffic\n     metricLensDimensions:\n       - Cities\n   - metricParameter: avg_bitrate\n     filters:\n       - _ALL_\n   - metricParameter: concurrent_plays\n   - metricParameter: audience_metriclens\n     filters:\n       - All Traffic\n     metricLensDimensions:\n       - _ALL_\n     excludeMetricLensDimensions:\n       - CDNs\n```\n\nAdd the extra dimension metric_source as shown in sample configuration below for the convenience of searching\nfor your metrics in SignalFx using the metric_source value you specify.\n\n```\nmonitors:\n- type: conviva\n pulseUsername: \u003cusername\u003e\n pulsePassword: \u003cpassword\u003e\n extraDimensions:\n   metric_source: conviva\n```\n",

See\nhttps://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/ for a description of the\nPrometheus metric types.  The conversion happens as follows:\n\n - Gauges are converted directly to SignalFx gauges\n - Counters are converted directly to SignalFx cumulative counters\n - Untyped metrics are converted directly to SignalFx gauges\n - Summary metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where\n   `\u003cbasename\u003e` is the root name of the metric:\n   - The total count gets converted to a cumulative counter called `\u003cbasename\u003e_count`\n   - The total sum gets converted to a cumulative counter called `\u003cbasename\u003e`\n   - Each quantile value is converted to a gauge called\n     `\u003cbasename\u003e_quantile` and will include a dimension called `quantile` that\n     specifies the quantile.\n - Histogram metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where\n   `\u003cbasename\u003e` is the root name of the metric:\n   - The total count gets converted to a cumulative counter called `\u003cbasename\u003e_count`\n   - The total sum gets converted to a cumulative counter called `\u003cbasename\u003e`\n   - Each histogram bucket is converted to a cumulative counter called\n     `\u003cbasename\u003e_bucket` and will include a dimension called `upper_bound` that\n     specifies the maximum value in that bucket.  This metric specifies the\n     number of events with a value that is less than or equal to the upper\n     bound.\n\nAll Prometheus labels will be converted directly to SignalFx dimensions.\n\nThis supports service discovery so you can set a discovery rule such as:\n\n`port \u003e= 9100 \u0026\u0026 port \u003c= 9500 \u0026\u0026 containerImage =~ \"exporter\"`\n\nassuming you are running exporters in container images that have the word\n\"exporter\" in them and fall within the standard exporter port range.  In\nK8s, you could also try matching on the container port name as defined in\nthe pod spec, which is the `name` variable in discovery rules for the\n`k8s-api` observer.\n\nFiltering can be very useful here since exporters tend to be fairly verbose.\n\nSample YAML configuration:\n\n```\nmonitors:\n - type: prometheus-exporter\n   discoveryRule: port \u003e= 9100 \u0026\u0026 port \u003c= 9500 \u0026\u0026 container_image =~ \"exporter\"\n   extraDimensions:\n     metric_source: prometheus\n```\n",

More information about the telegraf plugin\ncan be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver).\n\nYou will need to create a login on the SQL server for the monitor to use.  You can create this login by\nexecuting the following commands in an a SQL client while logged in as an administrator.\n\n```\nUSE master;\nGO\nCREATE LOGIN [signalfxagent] WITH PASSWORD = N'\u003cYOUR PASSWORD HERE\u003e';\nGO\nGRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [signalfxagent];\nGO\nGRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [signalfxagent];\nGO\n```\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nOn some Windows based SQL server distributions TCP/IP has been disabled by default.  This behavior\nhas been observed on Azure SQL server instances.  You may need to explicitly turn on TCP/IP for the\nSQL server if you see error messages simillar to the following.\n\n```\nCannot read handshake packet: read tcp: wsarecv: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.\n```\n\n1. Verify agent configurations are correct.\n2. Ensure TCP/IP is enabled for the SQL server by going to `Start` -\u003e `Administrative Tools` -\u003e `Computer Management`\n3. In the `Computer Management` side bar, drill down to `Services and Applications` -\u003e `SQL Server Configuration Manager` -\u003e `SQL Server Network Configuration`\n4. Select `Protocols for \u003cYOUR SQL SERVER NAME\u003e`.\n5. In the protocol list to the right, right-click on the `TCP/IP` protocol and `enable` it.\n\nSample YAML configuration:\n\n```yaml\nmonitors:\n - type: telegraf/sqlserver\n   host: hostname\n   port: 1433\n   userID: sa\n   password: P@ssw0rd!\n   appName: signalfxagent\n```\n",

      "doc": " Queries the Docker Engine API for running containers.  If\nyou are using Kubernetes, you should use the [k8s-api\nobserver](./k8s-api.md) instead of this.\n\nNote that you will need permissions to access the Docker engine API.  For a\nDocker domain socket URL, this means that the agent needs to have read\npermissions on the socket.  We don't currently support authentication for\nHTTP URLs.\n\n## Configuration from Labels\nYou can configure monitors by putting special labels on your Docker\ncontainers.  You can either specify all of the configuration in container\nlabels, or you can use the more traditional agent configuration with\ndiscovery rules and specify configuration overrides with labels.\n\nThe config labels are of the form `agent.signalfx.com.config.\u003cport\nnumber\u003e.\u003cconfig_key\u003e: \u003cconfig value\u003e`.  The `\u003cconfig value\u003e` must be a\nstring in a container label, but it will be deserialized as a YAML value to\nthe most appropriate type when consumed by the agent.  For example, if you\nhave a Redis container and want to monitor it at a higher frequency than\nother Redis containers, you could have an agent config that looks like the\nfollowing:\n\n```\nobservers:\n - type: docker\nmonitors:\n - type: collectd/redis\n   discoveryRule: container_image =~ \"redis\" \u0026\u0026 port == 6379\n   auth: mypassword\n   intervalSeconds: 10\n```\n\nAnd then launch the Redis container with the label:\n\n`agent.signalfx.com.config.6379.intervalSeconds`: `1`\n\nThis would cause the config value for `intervalSeconds` to be overwritten to\nthe more frequent 1 second interval.\n\nYou can also specify the monitor configuration entirely with Docker labels\nand completely omit monitor config from the agent config.  With the agent\nconfig:\n\n```\nobservers:\n - type: docker\n```\n\nYou can then launch a Redis container with the following labels:\n\n - `agent.signalfx.com.monitorType.6379`: `collectd/redis`\n - `agent.signalfx.com.config.6379.auth`: `mypassword`\n\nWhich would configure a Redis monitor with the given authentication\nconfiguration.  No Redis configuration is required in the agent config file.\n\nThe distinction is that the `monitorType` label was added to the Docker\ncontainer.  If a `monitorType` label is present, **no discovery rules will\nbe considered for this endpoint**, and thus, no agent configuration can be\nused anyway.\n\n### Multiple Monitors per Port\nIf you want to configure multiple monitors per port, you can specify the\nport name in the form `\u003cport number\u003e-\u003cport name\u003e` instead of just the port\nnumber.  For example, if you had two different Prometheus exporters running\non the same port, but on different paths in a given container, you could\nprovide labels like the following:\n\n```\n - `agent.signalfx.com.monitorType.8080-app`: `prometheus-exporter`\n - `agent.signalfx.com.config.8080-app.metricPath`: `/appMetrics`\n - `agent.signalfx.com.monitorType.8080-goruntime`: `prometheus-exporter`\n - `agent.signalfx.com.config.8080-goruntime.metricPath`: `/goMetrics`\n```\n\nThe name that is given to the port will populate the `name` field of the\ndiscovered endpoint and can be used in discovery rules as such.  For\nexample, with the following agent config:\n\n```\nobservers:\n - type: docker\nmonitors:\n - type: prometheus-exporter\n   discoveryRule: name == \"app\" \u0026\u0026 port == 8080\n   intervalSeconds: 1\n```\n\nAnd given docker labels as follows (remember that discovery rules are\nirrelevant to endpoints that specify `monitorType` labels):\n\n - `agent.signalfx.com.config.8080-app.metricPath`: `/appMetrics`\n - `agent.signalfx.com.config.8080-goruntime.metricPath`: `/goMetrics`\n\nWould result in the `app` endpoint getting an interval of 1 second and the\n`goruntime` endpoint getting the default interval of the agent.\n",
