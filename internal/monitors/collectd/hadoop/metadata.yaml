    Collects metrics about a Hadoop cluster using the
    [collectd Hadoop Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-hadoop).
    Also see
    https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-hadoop.

    The `collectd/hadoop` monitor will collect metrics from the Resource Manager
    REST API for the following:
    - Cluster Metrics
    - Cluster Scheduler
    - Cluster Applications
    - Cluster Nodes
    - MapReduce Jobs

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
    - type: collectd/hadoop
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 8088
    ```

    If a remote JMX port is exposed in the hadoop cluster, then
    you may also configure the [collectd/hadoopjmx](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/docs/monitors/collectd/hadoopjmx)
    monitor to collect additional metrics about the hadoop cluster.
