# memory

This monitor reports memory and memory utilization metrics.

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
/proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

```yaml
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: memory
```


Monitor Type: `memory`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/memory)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as [container/host/bundled](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
are marked as _Default_ in the table below.

| Name | Type | [Default](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `memory.available` | gauge |  | (Windows Only) Bytes of memory available for use. |
| `memory.buffered` | gauge | ✔ | (Linux Only) Bytes of memory used for buffering I/O. |
| `memory.cached` | gauge | ✔ | (Linux Only) Bytes of memory used for disk caching. |
| `memory.free` | gauge | ✔ | (Linux Only) Bytes of memory available for use. |
| `memory.slab_recl` | gauge | ✔ | (Linux Only) Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can be reclaimed. |
| `memory.slab_unrecl` | gauge | ✔ | (Linux Only) Bytes of memory, used for SLAB-allocation of kernel objects, that can't be reclaimed. |
| `memory.used` | gauge | ✔ | Bytes of memory in use by the system. |
| `memory.utilization` | gauge | ✔ | Percent of memory in use on this host. This metric reports with plugin dimension set to "signalfx-metadata". |



### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
