    This monitor collects cpu usage data using the
    collectd `cpu` plugin.  It aggregates the per-core CPU data into a single
    metric and sends it to the SignalFx Metadata plugin in collectd, where the
    raw jiffy counts from the `cpu` plugin are converted to percent utilization
    (the `cpu.utilization` metric).
