    doc: |
      A VMware vSphere deployment includes physical hosts, ESXi hypervisors, virtual machines, and vCenter Server.
      This monitor reports metrics for a vSphere deployment by logging into a vCenter Server and periodically
      retrieving data about the deployment and its real time performance data.

      When this monitor starts up, it logs into vCenter Server and traverses the inventory, gathering and caching all of
      the hosts and virtual machines, and their available metrics.

      Then it periodically queries the vCenter for the performance data for those metrics. It does so at a rate of
      once every 20 seconds, the interval at which vCenter makes real-time performance data avaialable.

      Because the 20 second interval for real-time metrics is fixed by vSphere, this monitor runs every 20 seconds,
      regardless of the IntervalSeconds value in the agent config.

      It also refreshes, at a configurable interval, the cache of hosts, virtual machines, and metrics. By default,
      it does this every 60 seconds, but this interval can be changed by updating the configuration field
      `InventoryRefreshInterval`.

      Compatibility:
      This monitor uses VMware's govmomi SDK, which is built for and tested against vCenter 6.0, 6.5 and 6.7.
      It may work with versions 5.5 and 5.1, but neither are officially supported.
