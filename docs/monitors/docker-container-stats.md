# docker-container-stats

This monitor reads container stats from a
Docker API server.  It is meant as a metric-compatible replacement of our
[docker-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin)
plugin, which scales rather poorly against a large number of containers.

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.

If you are running the agent directly on a host (outside of a container
itself) and you are using the default Docker UNIX socket URL, you will
probably need to add the `signalfx-agent` user to the `docker` group in
order to have permission to access the Docker API via the socket.

Requires Docker API version 1.22+.


Monitor Type: `docker-container-stats`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/docker)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enableExtraBlockIOMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra block IO metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraCPUMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra CPU metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraMemoryMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra memory metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enableExtraNetworkMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether it will send all extra network metrics as well. (**default:** `false`) |
| `dockerURL` | no | `string` | The URL of the docker server (**default:** `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `envToDimensions` | no | `map of strings` | A mapping of container environment variable names to dimension names.  The corresponding env var values become the dimension values on the emitted metrics.  E.g. `APP_VERSION: version` would result in datapoints having a dimension called `version` whose value is the value of the `APP_VERSION` envvar configured for that particular container, if present. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of strings` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.
