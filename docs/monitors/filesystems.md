# filesystems

This monitor reports metrics about free disk space on mounted devices.

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
/proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

```yaml
procPath: /hostfs/proc
monitors:
 - type: filesystems
   hostFSPath: /hostfs
```


Monitor Type: `filesystems`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/filesystems)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hostFSPath` | no | `string` | Path to the root of the host filesystem.  Useful when running in a container and the host filesystem is mounted in some subdirectory under /. |
| `fsTypes` | no | `list of strings` | The filesystem types to include/exclude.  This is an [overridable set](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filters). (**default:** `[* !aufs !overlay !tmpfs !proc !sysfs !nsfs !cgroup !devpts !selinuxfs !devtmpfs !debugfs !mqueue !hugetlbfs !securityfs !pstore !binfmt_misc !autofs]`) |
| `mountPoints` | no | `list of strings` | The mount paths to include/exclude. This is an [overridable set](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html#overridable-filters). NOTE: If you are using the hostFSPath option you should not include the `/hostfs/` mount in the filter. (**default:** `[* !/^/var/lib/docker/containers/ !/^/var/lib/rkt/pods/ !/^/net// !/^/smb// !/^/tmp/scratch/]`) |
| `includeLogical` | no | `bool` | (Linux Only) If true, then metrics will be reported about logical devices. (**default:** `false`) |
| `reportByDevice` | no | `bool` | If true, then metrics will report with their plugin_instance set to the device's name instead of the mountpoint. (**default:** `false`) |
| `reportInodes` | no | `bool` | (Linux Only) If true metrics will be reported about inodes. (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | [Bundled](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `df_complex.free` | gauge | ✔ | Free disk space in bytes |
| `df_complex.used` | gauge | ✔ | Used disk space in bytes |
| `df_inodes.free` | gauge |  | (Linux Only) Number of inodes that are free.  This is is only reported if the configuration option `inodes` is set to `true`. |
| `df_inodes.used` | gauge |  | (Linux Only) Number of inodes that are used.  This is only reported if the configuration option `inodes` is set to `true`. |
| `disk.summary_utilization` | gauge | ✔ | Percent of disk space utilized on all volumes on this host. This metric reports with plugin dimension set to "signalfx-metadata". |
| `disk.utilization` | gauge | ✔ | Percent of disk used on this volume. This metric reports with plugin dimension set to "signalfx-metadata". |
| `percent_bytes.free` | gauge |  | Free disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_bytes.used` | gauge |  | Used disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_inodes.free` | gauge |  | (Linux Only) Free inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage.  This is only reported if the configuration option `inodes` is set to `true`. |
| `percent_inodes.used` | gauge |  | (Linux Only) Used inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage.  This is only reported if the configuration option `inodes` is set to `true`. |



### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
