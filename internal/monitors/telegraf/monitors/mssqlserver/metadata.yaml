    This monitor reports metrics about Microsoft SQL servers.
    This monitor is based on the telegraf sqlserver plugin.  More information about the telegraf plugin
    can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver).

    You will need to create a login on the SQL server for the monitor to use.  You can create this login by
    executing the following commands in an a SQL client while logged in as an administrator.

    ```
    USE master;
    GO
    CREATE LOGIN [signalfxagent] WITH PASSWORD = N'<YOUR PASSWORD HERE>';
    GO
    GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [signalfxagent];
    GO
    GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [signalfxagent];
    GO
    ```

    Troubleshooting:

    On some Windows based SQL server distributions TCP/IP has been disabled by default.  This behavior
    has been observed on Azure SQL server instances.  You may need to explicitly turn on TCP/IP for the
    SQL server if you see error messages simillar to the following.

    ```
    Cannot read handshake packet: read tcp: wsarecv: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
    ```

    1. Verify agent configurations are correct.
    2. Ensure TCP/IP is enabled for the SQL server by going to `Start` -> `Administrative Tools` -> `Computer Management`
    3. In the `Computer Management` side bar, drill down to `Services and Applications` -> `SQL Server Configuration Manager` -> `SQL Server Network Configuration`
    4. Select `Protocols for <YOUR SQL SERVER NAME>`.
    5. In the protocol list to the right, right-click on the `TCP/IP` protocol and `enable` it.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: telegraf/sqlserver
       host: hostname
       port: 1433
       userID: sa
       password: P@ssw0rd!
       appName: signalfxagent
    ```
