This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `cpufreq.<N>` | gauge | X | The processor frequency in Hertz for the <N>th processor on the system. |

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - cpufreq.<N>
  negated: true
```
