    This monitor scrapes [Prmoetheus server's own internal
    collector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configuring-prometheus-to-monitor-itself)
    metrics from a Prometheus exporter and sends them to SignalFx.  It is a
    wrapper around the [prometheus-exporter](./prometheus-exporter.md) monitor
    that provides a restricted but expandable set of metrics.
