    Monitors a MySQL database server using collectd's
    [MySQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:MySQL).

    On Unix, MySQL programs treat the host name `localhost` specially, in a way
    that is likely different from what is expected compared to other
    network-based programs. For connections to `localhost`, MySQL programs
    attempt to connect to the local server by using a Unix socket file. To ensure
    that the client makes a TCP/IP connection to the local server specify a host
    name value of `127.0.0.1`, or the IP address or name of the local server.

    You have to specify each database you want to monitor individually under the
    `databases` key.  If you have a common authentication to all databases being
    monitored, you can specify that in the top-level `username`/`password`
    options, otherwise they can be specified at the database level.

    **Note:** The MySQL monitor supports MySQL versions 5.x or later.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```
    monitors:
     - type: collectd/mysql
       host: 127.0.0.1
       port: 3306
       databases:
         - name: dbname
         - name: securedb
           username: admin
           password: s3cr3t
       username: dbuser
       password: passwd
    ```
