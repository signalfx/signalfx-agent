See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-etcd and
https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-etcd


Monitor Type: `collectd/etcd`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/etcd)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `clusterName` | **yes** | `string` | An arbitrary name of the etcd cluster to make it easier to group together and identify instances. |
| `sslKeyFile` | no | `string` | Client private key if using client certificate authentication. |
| `sslCertificate` | no | `string` | Client public key if using client certificate authentication. |
| `sslCACerts` | no | `string` | Certificate authority or host certificate to trust. |
| `skipSSLValidation` | no | `bool` | If `true`, etcd's SSL certificate will not be verified. Enabling this option results in the `sslCACerts` option being ignored. (**default:** `false`) |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` |  (**default:** `false`) |

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
