# collectd/apache

 Monitors Apache webservice instances using
the information provided by `mod_status`.

See https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-apache

Sample YAML configuration:

```
monitors:
 - type: collectd/apache
   host: localhost
   port: 80
```

If `mod_status` is exposed on an endpoint other than `/mod_status`, you can
use the `url` config option to specify the path:

```
monitors:
 - type: collectd/apache
   host: localhost
   port: 80
   url: "http://{{.Host}}:{{.Port}}/server-status?auto"
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/apache`
