# filesystems


This monitor reports metrics about free disk space on mounted devices.

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` filesystem.
If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than
/proc please specify the path using the top level configuration `procPath`.

```yaml
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: filesystems
```


Monitor Type: `filesystems`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/filesystems)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fsTypes` | no | `list of string` | The filesystem types to include/exclude, is interpreted as a regex if surrounded by `/`. (**default:** `[* !aufs !overlay !tmpfs !proc !sysfs !nsfs !cgroup !devpts !selinuxfs !devtmpfs !debugfs !mqueue !hugetlbfs !securityfs !pstore !binfmt_misc !autofs]`) |
| `mountPoints` | no | `list of string` | The mount paths to include/exclude, is interpreted as a regex if surrounded by `/`.  Note that you need to include the full path as the agent will see it, irrespective of the hostFSPath option. (**default:** `[* !/^/var/lib/docker/containers/ !/^/var/lib/rkt/pods/ !/^/net// !/^/smb// !/^/tmp/scratch/]`) |
| `reportByDevice` | no | `bool` | If true, then metrics will report with their plugin_instance set to the device's name instead of the mountpoint. (**default:** `false`) |
| `reportInodes` | no | `bool` | (Linux Only) If true metrics will be reported about inodes. (**default:** `false`) |




## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are not marked as Custom are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `df_complex.free` | gauge |  | Free disk space in bytes |
| `df_complex.used` | gauge |  | Used disk space in bytes |
| `df_inodes.free` | gauge | X | (Linux Only) Number of inodes that are free.  This is is only reported if the configuration option `reportInodes` is set to `true`. |
| `df_inodes.used` | gauge | X | (Linux Only) Number of inodes that are used.  This is only reported if the configuration option `reportInodes` is set to `true`. |
| `disk.summary_utilization` | gauge |  | Percent of disk space utilized on all volumes on this host. This metric reports with plugin dimension set to "signalfx-metadata". |
| `disk.utilization` | gauge |  | Percent of disk used on this volume. This metric reports with plugin dimension set to "signalfx-metadata". |
| `percent_bytes.free` | gauge | X | Free disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_bytes.used` | gauge | X | Used disk space on the file system, expressed as a percentage. |
| `percent_inodes.free` | gauge | X | (Linux Only) Free inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage.  This is only reported if the configuration option `reportInodes` is set to `true`. |
| `percent_inodes.used` | gauge | X | (Linux Only) Used inodes on the file system, expressed as a percentage.  This is only reported if the configuration option `reportInodes` is set to `true`. |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - df_inodes.free
    - df_inodes.used
    - percent_bytes.free
    - percent_bytes.used
    - percent_inodes.free
    - percent_inodes.used
    monitorType: filesystems
```
