      This monitor pulls metrics from all PostgreSQL databases from a specific
      Postgres server instance.  It pulls basic information that is applicable
      to any database.

      ## Metrics about Queries

      In order to get metrics about query execution time, you must enable the
      `pg_stat_statements` extension.  This extension must be specified in the
      `shared_preload_libraries` config option in the main PostgreSQL
      configuration at server start up.  Then the extension must be enabled for
      each database by running `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS
      pg_stat_statements;` on each database.

      Note that in order to get consistent and accurate query execution time
      metrics, you must set the [pg_stat_statements.max config
      option](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631)
      to larger than the number of distinct queries on the server.

      Here is a [sample configuration of Postgres to enable statement tracking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631).

      Tested with PostgreSQL 9.2+.

      If you want to collect additional metrics about PostgreSQL, use the [sql monitor](./sql.md).

    dimensions:
      - name: type
        description: Whether the object (table, index, function, etc.) belongs to the `system` or `user`.
      - name: table
        description: The name of the table to which the metric pertains.
      - name: database
        description: The name of the database within a PostgreSQL server to which the metric pertains.
      - name: schemaname
        description: The name of the schema within which the object being monitored resides (e.g. `public`).
      - name: index
        description: For index metrics, the name of the index
      - name: user
        description: For query metrics, the user name of the user that executed the queries.
      - name: tablespace
        description: For table metrics, the tablespace in which the table belongs, if not null.

    metrics:
      - name: postgres_sessions
        description: Number of sessions currently on the server instance.  The `state` dimension will specify which which type of session (see `state` row of [pg_stat_activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW)).
        type: gauge
        included: true
      - name: postgres_block_hit_ratio
        description: The proportion (between 0 and 1, inclusive) of block reads that used the cache and did not have to go to the disk.  Is sent for `table`, `index`, and the `database` as a whole.
        type: gauge
        included: true
      - name: postgres_database_size
        type: gauge
        description: Size in bytes of the database on disk
        included: true
      - name: postgres_deadlocks
        description: Total number of deadlocks detected by the system
        type: cumulative
        included: true
      - name: postgres_query_count
        description: |
          Total number of queries executed on the `database`, broken down by
          `user`.  Note that the accuracy of this metric depends on the
          PostgreSQL [pg_stat_statements.max config
          option](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/pgstatstatements.html#AEN160631)
          being large enough to hold all queries.
        type: cumulative
        included: true
      - name: postgres_query_time
        description: Total time taken to execute queries on the `database`, broken down by `user`.
        type: cumulative
        included: true
      - name: postgres_rows_inserted
        type: cumulative
        description: Number of rows inserted into the `table`.
        included: true
      - name: postgres_rows_updated
        type: cumulative
        description: Number of rows updated in the `table`.
        included: true
      - name: postgres_rows_deleted
        type: cumulative
        description: Number of rows deleted from the `table`.
        included: true

        type: cumulative
        description: Total number of index scans on the `table`.
        included: true
      - name: postgres_table_size
        type: gauge
        description: The size in bytes of the `table` on disk.
        included: true
      - name: postgres_live_rows
        type: gauge
        description: Number of rows live (not deleted) in the `table`.
