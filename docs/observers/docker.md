# docker

 Queries the Docker Engine API for running containers.  If
you are using Kubernetes, you should use the [k8s-api
observer](./k8s-api.md) instead of this.

Note that you will need permissions to access the Docker engine API.  For a
Docker domain socket URL, this means that the agent needs to have read
permissions on the socket.  We don't currently support authentication for
HTTP URLs.


Observer Type: `docker`

[Observer Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/observers/docker)

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerURL` | no | `string` |  (**default:** `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) |
| `pollIntervalSeconds` | no | `integer` | How often to poll the docker API (**default:** `10`) |




## Endpoint Variables

The following fields are available on endpoints generated by this observer and
can be used in discovery rules.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---         |
| `container_name` | `string` | The first and primary name of the container as it is known to the container runtime (e.g. Docker). |
| `ip_address` | `string` | The IP address of the endpoint if the `host` is in the from of an IPv4 address |
| `network_port` | `string` | An alias for `port` |
| `private_port` | `string` | The port that the service endpoint runs on inside the container |
| `public_port` | `string` | The port exposed outside the container |
| `alternate_port` | `integer` | Used for services that are accessed through some kind of NAT redirection as Docker does.  This could be either the public port or the private one. |
| `container_command` | `string` | The command used when running the container exposing the endpoint |
| `container_id` | `string` | The ID of the container exposing the endpoint |
| `container_image` | `string` | The image name of the container exposing the endpoint |
| `container_labels` | `map of string` | A map that contains container label key/value pairs. You can use the `Contains` and `Get` helper functions in discovery rules to make use of this. See [Endpoint Discovery](../auto-discovery.md#additional-functions). |
| `container_names` | `list of string` | A list of container names of the container exposing the endpoint |
| `container_state` | `string` | The container state, will usually be "running" since otherwise the container wouldn't have a port exposed to be discovered. |
| `discovered_by` | `string` | The observer that discovered this endpoint |
| `host` | `string` | The hostname/IP address of the endpoint |
| `id` | `string` |  |
| `name` | `string` | A observer assigned name of the endpoint |
| `orchestrator` | `integer` |  |
| `port` | `integer` | The TCP/UDP port number of the endpoint |
| `port_labels` | `map of string` | A map of labels on the container port. You can use the `Contains` and `Get` helper functions in discovery rules to make use of this. See [Endpoint Discovery](../auto-discovery.md#additional-functions). |
| `port_type` | `string` | TCP or UDP |

## Dimensions

These dimensions are added to all metrics that are emitted for this service
endpoint.  These variables are also available to use as variables in discovery
rules.

| Name | Description |
| ---  | ---         |
| `container_name` | The primary name of the running container -- Docker containers can have multiple names but this will be the first name, if any. |
| `container_image` | The image name (including tags) of the running container |
