# elasticsearch

This monitor collects stats from Elasticsearch. It collects node, cluster
and index level stats. This monitor is compatible with the current collectd
plugin found [here] (https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-elasticsearch) in
terms of metric naming.

This monitor collects cluster level and index level stats only from the current master
in an Elasticsearch cluster by default. It is possible to override this with the
`clusterHealthStatsMasterOnly` and `indexStatsMasterOnly` config options respectively.

A simple configuration that collects only default metrics looks like the following

```
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
```

By default thread pool stats from "search" and "index" thread pools are collected. To collect
stats from other thread pools follow the below pattern.

```
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
 threadPools:
	- bulk
	- warmer
	- listener
```
The monitor collects a subset of node stats of JVM, process, HTTP, transport, indices and thread
pool stats. It is possible to enable enhanced stats for each group separately. Here's an example:

```
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
 enableEnhancedHTTPStats: true
 enableEnhancedJVMStats: true
 enableEnhancedProcessStats: true
 enableEnhancedThreadPoolStats: true
 enableEnhancedTransportStats: true
 enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats:
	- indexing
	- warmer
 - get
```

The `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats` option takes a list of index stats groups for which enhanced
stats will be collected. A comprehensive list of all available such groups can be found
[here] (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-nodes-stats.html#node-indices-stats).

Note that the `enableEnhancedIndexStatsForIndexGroups` is similar to `enableEnhancedNodeIndicesStats`,
but for index level stats

By default the monitor collects a subset of index stats of total aggregation type (see docs for details).
It is possible to enable index stats of primaries aggregation type too. Total for an index stat
aggregates across all shards. Whereas, Primaries only reflect the stats from primary shards. An example
configuration to enable index stats from Primary shards too

```
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
 enableIndexStatsPrimaries: true
```

It is possible to collect index level stats that are aggregated across all indexes, rather than one a per index level

```
monitors:
- type: elasticsearch
 host: localhost
 port: 9200
 IndexSummaryOnly: true
```

To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.
