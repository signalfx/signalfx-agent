# collectd/jenkins

Monitors jenkins by using the
[jenkins collectd Python
plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-jenkins), which collects
metrics from jenkins instances

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
```

Sample YAML configuration with specific enhanced metrics included

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  includeMetrics:
  - "vm.daemon.count"
  - "vm.terminated.count"
```

Sample YAML configuration with all enhanced metrics included

```yaml
monitors:
- type: collectd/jenkins
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 8080
  metricsKey: reallylongmetricskey
  enhancedMetrics: true
```


Monitor Type: `collectd/jenkins`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/jenkins)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

**For a list of monitor options that are common to all monitors, see [Common
Configuration](../monitor-config.md#common-configuration).**

| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `metricsKey` | **yes** | `string` | Key required for collecting metrics.  The access key located at `Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Metrics > ADD.` If empty, click `Generate`. |
| `enhancedMetrics` | no | `bool` | Whether to enable enhanced metrics (**default:** `false`) |
| `includeMetrics` | no | `list of strings` | Used to enable individual enhanced metrics when `enhancedMetrics` is false |
| `username` | no | `string` | User with security access to jenkins |
| `apiToken` | no | `string` | API Token of the user |
| `sslKeyFile` | no | `string` | Path to the keyfile |
| `sslCertificate` | no | `string` | Path to the certificate |
| `sslCACerts` | no | `string` | Path to the ca file |


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
are marked as _Default_ in the table below.

| Name | Type | [Default](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `gauge.jenkins.job.duration` | gauge | ✔ | Time taken to complete the job in ms. |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.executor.count.value` | gauge | ✔ | Total Number of executors in an instance |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.executor.in-use.value` | gauge | ✔ | Total number of executors being used in an instance |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.health-check.score` | gauge | ✔ | Mean health score of an instance |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.health.disk.space` | gauge | ✔ | Binary value of disk space health |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.health.plugins` | gauge | ✔ | Boolean value indicating state of plugins |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.health.temporary.space` | gauge | ✔ | Binary value of temporary space health |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.health.thread-deadlock` | gauge | ✔ | Boolean value indicating a deadlock |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.online.status` | gauge | ✔ | Boolean value of instance is reachable or not |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.queue.size.value` | gauge | ✔ | Total number pending jobs in queue |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.slave.online.status` | gauge | ✔ | Boolean value for slave is reachable or not |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.heap.usage` | gauge | ✔ | Percent utilization of the heap memory |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.non-heap.used` | gauge | ✔ | Total amount of non-heap memory used |
| `gauge.jenkins.node.vm.memory.total.used` | gauge | ✔ | Total Memory used by instance |



### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
