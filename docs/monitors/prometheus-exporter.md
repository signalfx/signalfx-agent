# prometheus-exporter

This monitor reads metrics from a [Prometheus
exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) endpoint.

All metric types are supported.  See
https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/ for a description of the
Prometheus metric types.  The conversion happens as follows:

 - Gauges are converted directly to SignalFx gauges
 - Counters are converted directly to SignalFx cumulative counters
 - Untyped metrics are converted directly to SignalFx gauges
 - Summary metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where
   `<basename>` is the root name of the metric:
   - The total count gets converted to a cumulative counter called `<basename>_count`
   - The total sum gets converted to a cumulative counter called `<basename>`
   - Each quantile value is converted to a gauge called
     `<basename>_quantile` and will include a dimension called `quantile` that
     specifies the quantile.
 - Histogram metrics are converted to three distinct metrics, where
   `<basename>` is the root name of the metric:
   - The total count gets converted to a cumulative counter called `<basename>_count`
   - The total sum gets converted to a cumulative counter called `<basename>`
   - Each histogram bucket is converted to a cumulative counter called
     `<basename>_bucket` and will include a dimension called `upper_bound` that
     specifies the maximum value in that bucket.  This metric specifies the
     number of events with a value that is less than or equal to the upper
     bound.

All Prometheus labels will be converted directly to SignalFx dimensions.

This supports service discovery so you can set a discovery rule such as:

`port >= 9100 && port <= 9500 && containerImage =~ "exporter"`

assuming you are running exporters in container images that have the word
"exporter" in them and fall within the standard exporter port range.  In
K8s, you could also try matching on the container port name as defined in
the pod spec, which is the `name` variable in discovery rules for the
`k8s-api` observer.

Filtering can be very useful here since exporters tend to be fairly verbose.

Sample YAML configuration:

```
monitors:
 - type: prometheus-exporter
   discoveryRule: port >= 9100 && port <= 9500 && container_image =~ "exporter"
   extraDimensions:
     metric_source: prometheus
```

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` | Host of the exporter |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` | Port of the exporter |
| `useHTTPS` | no | `bool` | If true, the agent will connect to the exporter using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. (**default:** `false`) |
| `skipVerify` | no | `bool` | If useHTTPS is true and this option is also true, the exporter's TLS cert will not be verified. (**default:** `false`) |
| `metricPath` | no | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server, usually `/metrics` (the default). (**default:** `/metrics`) |
