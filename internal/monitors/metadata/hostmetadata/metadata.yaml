    This monitor collects metadata properties about a
    host.  It is required for some views in SignalFx to operate.

    ```yaml
    monitors:
      - type: host-metadata
    ```

    In containerized environments host `/etc` and `/proc` may not be located
    directly under the root path.  You can specify the path to `proc` and `etc`
    using the top level agent configurations `procPath` and `etcPath`

    ```yaml
    procPath: /proc
    etcPath: /etc
    monitors:
      - type: host-metadata
    ```

    Metadata updates occur on a sparse interval of approximately
    1m, 1m, 1h, 1d and continues repeating once per day.
    Setting the `Interval` configuration for this monitor will not affect the
    sparse interval on which metadata is collected.
