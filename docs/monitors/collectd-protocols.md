# collectd/protocols

 Gathers metrics about the network protocol
stacks running on the system by using the [collectd protocols
plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Protocols).

See the [integrations
doc](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-protocols)
for more information.


Monitor Type: `collectd/protocols`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/protocols)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `protocol_counter.ActiveOpens` | cumulative |  | The number of times TCP connections transitioned from the CLOSED state to the SYN-SENT state. |
| `protocol_counter.CurrEstab` | cumulative | X | The number of TCP connections currently in either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT state. |
| `protocol_counter.DelayedACKs` | cumulative | X | The number of acknowledgements delayed by TCP Delayed Acknowledgement |
| `protocol_counter.InDestUnreachs` | cumulative | X | The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable messages received |
| `protocol_counter.PassiveOpens` | cumulative | X | The number of times that a server opened a connection, due to receiving a TCP SYN packet. |
| `protocol_counter.RetransSegs` | cumulative | X | The total number of segments retransmitted |

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - protocol_counter.CurrEstab
  - protocol_counter.DelayedACKs
  - protocol_counter.InDestUnreachs
  - protocol_counter.PassiveOpens
  - protocol_counter.RetransSegs
  negated: true
```
