    See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kong)
    for more information.

    The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
    described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
