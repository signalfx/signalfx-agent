# collectd/kong

 Monitors a Kong instance using [collectd-kong](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong).

See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kong)
for more information.

The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/kong
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8001
    metrics:
      - metric: request_latency
        report: true
      - metric: connections_accepted
        report: false
```

Sample YAML configuration with custom /signalfx route and white and blacklists

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: collectd/kong
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8443
    url: https://127.0.0.1:8443/routed_signalfx
    authHeader:
      header: Authorization
      value: HeaderValue
    metrics:
      - metric: request_latency
        report: true
    reportStatusCodeGroups: true
    statusCodes:
      - 202
      - 403
      - 405

      - "5*"
    serviceNamesBlacklist:
      - "*SomeService*"
```
