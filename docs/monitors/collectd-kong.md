See the [integration documentation](https://github.com/signalfx/integrations/tree/master/collectd-kong)
for more information.

The `metrics` field below is populated with a set of metrics that are
described at https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-kong/blob/master/README.md.

Sample YAML configuration:

```yaml
monitors:

## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor.
Metrics that are categorized as
[container/host](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics)
are marked as _Default_ in the table below.

| Name | Type | [Default](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/usage.html#about-custom-bundled-and-high-resolution-metrics) | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `counter.kong.connections.accepted` | cumulative |  | Total number of all accepted connections. |
| `counter.kong.connections.handled` | cumulative |  | Total number of all handled connections (accounting for resource limits). |
| `counter.kong.kong.latency` | cumulative | ✔ | Time spent in Kong request handling and balancer (ms). |
| `counter.kong.requests.count` | cumulative | ✔ | Total number of all requests made to Kong API and proxy server. |
| `counter.kong.requests.latency` | cumulative | ✔ | Time elapsed between the first bytes being read from each client request and the log writes after the last bytes were sent to the clients (ms). |
| `counter.kong.requests.size` | cumulative | ✔ | Total bytes received/proxied from client requests. |
| `counter.kong.responses.count` | cumulative | ✔ | Total number of responses provided to clients. |
| `counter.kong.responses.size` | cumulative | ✔ | Total bytes sent/proxied to clients. |
| `counter.kong.upstream.latency` | cumulative | ✔ | Time spent waiting for upstream response (ms). |
| `gauge.kong.connections.active` | gauge | ✔ | The current number of active client connections (includes waiting). |
| `gauge.kong.connections.reading` | gauge | ✔ | The current number of connections where nginx is reading the request header. |
| `gauge.kong.connections.waiting` | gauge | ✔ | The current number of idle client connections waiting for a request. |
| `gauge.kong.connections.writing` | gauge | ✔ | The current number of connections where nginx is writing the response back to the client. |
| `gauge.kong.database.reachable` | gauge | ✔ | kong.dao:db.reachable() at time of metric query |



### Non-default metrics (version 4.7.0+)

**The following information applies to the agent version 4.7.0+ that has
`enableBuiltInFiltering: true` set on the top level of the agent config.**

To emit metrics that are not _default_, you can add those metrics in the
generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` config option.  Metrics that are derived
from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above table do
not need to be added to `extraMetrics`.

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted you can run `agent-status
monitors` after configuring this monitor in a running agent instance.



### Legacy non-default metrics (version < 4.7.0)

**The following information only applies to agent version older than 4.7.0. If
you have a newer agent and have set `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` at the top
level of your agent config, see the section above. See upgrade instructions in
[Old-style whitelist filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#old-style-whitelist-filtering).**

If you have a reference to the `whitelist.json` in your agent's top-level
`metricsToExclude` config option, and you want to emit metrics that are not in
that whitelist, then you need to add an item to the top-level
`metricsToInclude` config option to override that whitelist (see [Inclusion
filtering](../legacy-filtering.md#inclusion-filtering).  Or you can just
copy the whitelist.json, modify it, and reference that in `metricsToExclude`.
