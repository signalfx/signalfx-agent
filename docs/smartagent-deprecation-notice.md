# Deprecaton Notice for SignalFx Smart Agent

Smart Agent is deprecated in conjunction with the release of Splunk Observability Cloud:

* Smart Agent continues to function and is still supported by Splunk.
* Apart from the [documented exceptions](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/get-started/migrate/migrate-to-otel.html) where integration with Splunk Observability Cloud still requires deploying Smart Agent, Smart Agent functionality is replaced by the [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Connector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/get-started/get-data-in/get-data-in.html).
* Splunk is committed to further development of OpenTelemetry, and might remove Smart Agent in a future version.
