> The [Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector) is the successor.
>
> To learn how to migrate, see [Migrate from SignalFx Smart Agent to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/smart-agent-migration-to-otel-collector.html).
