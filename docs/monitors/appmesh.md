# appmesh

This monitor starts a StatsD monitor to listen to StatsD metrics emitted
by AWS AppMesh Envoy Proxy.

To report AppMesh Envoy metrics, you need to enable Envoy StatsD sink on AppMesh
and deploy the agent as a sidecar in the services that need to be monitored.


Sample Envoy StatsD configuration:

```yaml
stats_sinks:
 -
  name: "envoy.statsd"
  config:
   address:
    socket_address:
     address: "127.0.0.1"
     port_value: 8125
     protocol: "UDP"
   prefix: statsd.appmesh
```
Please remember to provide the prefix to the agent monitor configuration.

See [Envoy API reference](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-metrics-v2-statsdsink) for more info

Sample SignalFx SmartAgent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: appmesh
   listenAddress: 0.0.0.0
   listenPort: 8125
   metricPrefix: statsd.appmesh
```


Monitor Type: `appmesh`

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Built in filtering
This monitor will perform built-in filtering if you are using agent version
4.7.0+ and have the `enableBuiltInFiltering: true` option set at the top-level
of your agent config.  See
[Filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html)
for more information.
