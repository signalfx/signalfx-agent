# collectd/cpu

This monitor collects cpu usage data using the
collectd `cpu` plugin.  It aggregates the per-core CPU data into a single
metric and sends it to the SignalFx Metadata plugin in collectd, where the
raw jiffy counts from the `cpu` plugin are converted to percent utilization
(the `cpu.utilization` metric).

See https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU


Monitor Type: `collectd/cpu`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/cpu)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: **No**

## Configuration

This monitor has no configuration options.


## Metrics

The following table lists the metrics available for this monitor. Metrics that are marked as Included are standard metrics and are monitored by default.

| Name | Type | Included | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `cpu.idle` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.interrupt` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.nice` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.softirq` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.steal` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.system` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.user` | cumulative |  |  |
| `cpu.wait` | cumulative |  |  |


To specify custom metrics you want to monitor, add a `metricsToInclude` filter
to the agent configuration, as shown in the code snippet below. The snippet
lists all available custom metrics. You can copy and paste the snippet into
your configuration file, then delete any custom metrics that you do not want
sent.

Note that some of the custom metrics require you to set a flag as well as add
them to the list. Check the monitor configuration file to see if a flag is
required for gathering additional metrics.

```yaml

metricsToInclude:
  - metricNames:
    - cpu.idle
    - cpu.interrupt
    - cpu.nice
    - cpu.softirq
    - cpu.steal
    - cpu.system
    - cpu.user
    - cpu.wait
    monitorType: collectd/cpu
