[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/disk)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |

| `disks` | no | `list of string` | Which devices to include/exclude (**default:** `[/^loop\d+$/ /^dm-\d+$/]`) |
| `ignoreSelected` | no | `bool` | If true, the disks selected by `disks` will be excluded and all others included. (**default:** `true`) |




## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.

| Name | Type | Custom | Description |
| ---  | ---  | ---    | ---         |
| `disk_merged.read` | cumulative | X | The number of disk reads merged into single physical disk access operations. |
| `disk_merged.write` | cumulative | X | The number of disk writes merged into single physical disk access operations. |
| `disk_octets.read` | cumulative | X | The number of bytes (octets) read from a disk. |
| `disk_octets.write` | cumulative | X | The number of bytes (octets) written to a disk. |
| `disk_ops.read` | cumulative |  | The number of disk read operations. |
| `disk_ops.write` | cumulative |  | The number of disk write operations. |
| `disk_time.read` | cumulative | X | The average amount of time it took to do a read operation. |
| `disk_time.write` | cumulative | X | The average amount of time it took to do a write operation. |

Custom metrics may or not be collected by this monitor by default. Check the monitor configuration to see if additional flags are required for gathering additional metrics.
Any custom metrics above may be reported by the agent by adding a negated `metricsToExclude` to the monitor configuration, as shown below.
```yaml 
metricsToExclude:
  - disk_merged.read
  - disk_merged.write
  - disk_octets.read
  - disk_octets.write
  - disk_time.read
  - disk_time.write
  negated: true
```
