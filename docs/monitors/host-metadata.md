# host-metadata

 This monitor collects metadata properties about a
host.  It is required for some views in SignalFx to operate.

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: host-metadata
```

In containerized environments host `/etc` and `/proc` may not be located
directly under the root path.  You can specify the path to `proc` and `etc`
using the monitor configurations `procFSPath` and `etcPath`

```yaml
monitors:
  - type: host-metadata
    procFSPath: "/hostfs/proc"
    etcPath: "/hostfs/etc"
```

Metadata updates occur on a sparse interval of approximately
1m, 1m, 1h, 1d and continues repeating once per day.
Setting the `Interval` configuration for this monitor will not affect the
sparse interval on which metadata is collected.


Monitor Type: `host-metadata`
