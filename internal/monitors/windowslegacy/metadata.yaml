    (Windows Only) This monitor reports metrics for Windows system Performance Counters.
    The metric names are intended to match what was originally reported by
    the SignalFx [PerfCounterReporter](https://github.com/signalfx/PerfCounterReporter)
    The metric types are all gauges as originally reported by the PerfCounterReporter.

    ## Windows Performance Counters
    The underlying source for these metrics are Windows Performance Counters.
    Most of the performance counters that we query in this monitor are actually
    rates per second and percentages that we report as instantaneous Gauge values
    each collection interval.

    Sample YAML configuration:

    ```yaml
    monitors:
     - type: windows-legacy
    ```
