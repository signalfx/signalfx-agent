# NAME

**signalfx-agent** -- The SignalFx metric collection agent

# SYNOPSIS

| **signalfx-agent** \[**-config** path] \[**-debug**] \[**-version**]

| **signalfx-agent** **status**

# DESCRIPTION

Runs the SignalFx metric collection agent that optionally discovers services
running in the local environment and monitors them, sending metrics to the
SignalFx backend for processing.

The agent does not fork to the background and has no such option to do so.

If the **status** subcommand is invoked it connects to the configured diagnostic
socket and dumps diagnostic information about the agent to stdout.

See https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent for more information and
configuration documentation, as well as to file bug reports or ask questions.
